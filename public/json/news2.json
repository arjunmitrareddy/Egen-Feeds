      "text": "\nYou’re not supposed to host services on consumer internet connections, but many people do.\nAs long as you’re not serving too much traffic, and you don’t mind your IP changing every once in a while (for those who don’t have static IPs), it generally works.\nThis applies to common ports like 22, 23, 80, 443, all the Windows networking ports, database ports, whatever. For most ISPs, you have wide open inbound connectivity.\nBut now IoT is becoming a problem.\nI think one of the controls we’re going to see a lot of ISPs doing in 2017 is massively limiting inbound connectivity to their consumer ranges. It’s restrictive. It’ll make a lot of people mad. But compared to having a legion of misbehaving IoT systems attacking the world from your network it looks pretty smart.\nI’m sure some companies are already doing this, but we should expect it to get FAR more popular.\nExpect to see it become the norm while we get the devices themselves sorted out, along with active scans for devices to see who’s hosting things that they shouldn’t be.\nIt’ll be a while.\nNotes Blocking inbound won’t solve all issues, of course. One opening it leaves is when devices connect outbound to a cloud-based meeting point, where a mobile app or web login then enables control of the device from the Internet. Control of smart home devices from mobile apps while traveling will continue to be considered core functionality, so this will be an issue for the foreseeable future. --\n:: Inbound Filtering as an ISP Defense Against IoT Attacks appeared originally on danielmiessler.com .\n\n:: Subscribe to Unsupervised Learning --- my weekly show where I select my favorite news and ideas in infosec, technology, and humanity, and talk about why they matter.\n",

      "text": "Blog This Is it time for ships to sail off on a journey by themselves? As the Internet of Things (IoT) connects the world, while the robotics industry continues to innovate, man and machine are merging together like never before. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have impacted a number of industries from agriculture to security. If recent news is correct, it won’t be long before autonomous cars are traveling roads alongside us. Now, organizations and government agencies around the world are actively working to bring autonomous vessels to our oceans. What can we expect from unmanned ships operating in our largest bodies of water? IoT and robotics are being considered for a variety of commercial and military purposes at sea. For most of the world, it seems autonomous ships are in the testing phase, but there are big plans in the works around the globe: The British engine maker Rolls Royce Holdings, PLC is leading the Advanced Autonomous Waterborne Applications initiative with several other organizations and universities. The company is eyeing a timeline of remotely controlled ships setting sail by 2030 with completely autonomous ships in service by 2035. The timeline will be heavily dependent upon automation technologies’ ability to carry large amount of data from ship to shore to ensure safe operations. Recently , the UK’s Automated Ships Ltd and Norway’s Kongsberg Maritime, unveiled plans for a light-duty ship for surveying, delivering cargo to offshore installations and launching and recovering smaller remote-controlled and autonomous vehicles. “This ship is considered the world’s first unmanned ship for offshore operations and is being eyed for many uses including offshore energy, fish farming and scientific industries.” In the U.S., the Navy has begun to consider autonomous ships for a number of applications, but is cautiously approaching these new technology advancements. According to National Defense Magazine , “The Navy for now appears to be in no hurry to pour big money into drone ships and submarines. And there is little tolerance these days for risky gambles on technologies.” However, the article acknowledges that robots at sea could help do the jobs that are dangerous or costly for human operators, such as hunting enemy submarines, detonating sea mines, medical evacuations and ship repairs. The European Union (EU) appears to have a vested interest in sea robotics. As infrastructure costs rise for improving rails and roads, they have begun to seek alternative ways to move large quantities of cargo. According to Maritime Executive they have, “had a long-term goal of making short sea shipping more competitive with road and rail transport, which is under stress from the transportation bottlenecks caused by increasing volumes of internal trade.” As the EU faces massive infrastructure costs to upgrade road and rail, there is increased attention and effort directed at the “motorways of the sea.” The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) has been testing a robotic ship called the “Continuous Trail Unmanned Vessel,” and has been running sea trials on its radar system. The radar is fastened to a parasail that enables heights of 500-1,500 feet. These are just a few of the autonomous vessel projects in the works. In order for unmanned vessels to operate, it is clear the ability to transport data in massive amounts will play a critical role in the success and safety of those sharing the sea with autonomous ships. As technologies evolve to meet these big data needs, we can eventually expect to see more unmanned vessels in the sea, improving offshore applications, making human jobs safer, and creating new efficiencies for organizations looking to optimize international trade.

      "text": "Less than a month ago, hackers took control of an ocean of unsecured connected home devices, then essentially crashed the entire internet by using them to flood the web's largest internet management company with bogus traffic. Now, the makers of smart gadgets that communicate using Z-Wave are ratcheting up their security standards to help reassure consumers that their products don't come with glaring vulnerabilities.\n\"No one can afford to sit on their hands and wait,\" says Mitchell Klein, executive director of the Z-Wave Alliance. \"Consumers deserve IoT devices in their home to have the strongest levels of security possible. IoT smart home technologies that don't act will be left behind.\"\nThe new standards are called the \"Security 2\" framework, or S2 for short. Aside from shoring up encryption standards for transmissions between sensors, cameras, and thermostats that broadcast using Z-Wave, S2 also mandates new pairing procedures for each device -- namely, unique PIN or QR codes on the devices themselves. That's similar to the approach Apple takes with HomeKit-compatible smart gadgets, each of which comes with a unique pairing code printed on the device.\nThat device-specific layer of authentication helps keep would-be hackers from taking control of your gadgets from afar, and also helps to separate Z-Wave gear from the kinds of devices that were used in last month's massive cyber-attack. According to reports , the majority of those devices were things like internet-connected printers, DVR boxes and cheap IP cameras that use default passwords out of the box to launch setup. Many users never think to change those passwords once their device is up and running, which is how hackers were able to take control of so many of them all at once.\nEngineers from the Z-Wave Alliance also tell me that the S2 framework will largely be backward compatible for existing Z-Wave devices that support over-the-air firmware updates. Wherever possible, these updates will include client-side authentication that helps fill the same role as those device-specific pairing codes. For instance, if you have a Z-Wave keypad deadbolt that you want to update, it could display a randomized code on the lock for you to punch in first.\nThe new framework isn't expected to have any noticeable impact on device performance -- in fact, Z-Wave engineers tell me that the streamlined encryption process could actually speed up response times and improve battery life in addition to making things harder to hack.\nThe Z-Wave Alliance certifies the security of its devices at third-party test facilities in the US, Europe and Asia, and says that it will require all devices to be S2-compliant by April of 2017.\nShare your voice 0 comments Join the conversation",

It is hard today primarily because the required skill set becomes less and less current, but it is all demand-driven, it was not so some time ago.\nSecondly, it could be replicated to some extent only -- for example, verified libraries for each device could come from each HW IP provider, instead of coming from the SoC vendor who integrated them. Say, Synopsis would provide a verified lib for the GbE controller -- to use with all SoCs that integrate it, etc. And the final integrator would take care of verifying the final integration, including his very small, fast, low-power-consuming and maintainable and 100%-dedicated kernel.\nBut my main argument is that the alternative is not so good-looking either. Porting and validation of the Linux kernel is performed mostly by engineers who have not the required skillset (managerial decision to spare on hires since \"we have Linux\") -- this is also something that I wish wasn't replicated among product makers but is, unfortunately.",

I'm not even sure how this process would work in terms of formal verification; even sel4 is forced to make assumptions about hardware.\nThe reason why you get bad Linux ports with no source and universal default passwords is simply cost.

Those pesky little theorems would become much more general and would come in even greater numbers?\nVerifying a generic OS, good for all devices and all application, if at all doable from theoretical standpoint, looks too much of work for no particular profit for the verifier (very similar to the validation of the Linux kernel which is relayed on to the distro builders).\nI wouldn't be as pessimistic either about the hardware vendors. After all, (some of them) already use formal verification in (some of) the silicon design, and verifying closer to the silicon seems simpler -- the closer to the metal the less genericity (assuming the verified silicon underneath).",

      "text": "The Internet of Things is transforming how we work and live in more ways than many of us could have imagined. Connecting things with unique IP addresses has been possible for over a decade, but the commoditization of sensors and processors and emerging technologies that further enable IoT possibilities are making it viable to move beyond being just connected, into an intelligent Internet of Things.\nGetting Smarter About Wiring the IoT One of the unique challenges of the Internet of Things is stepping into an object oriented world, and understanding how to link together so many disparate objects that speak different languages. The average IoT engineer is not interested in diving into the coding necessary to drive these interactions, they want to quickly be able to pull in operational data and glean new insights from it. This is where a tool that simplifies wiring together the IoT becomes incredibly valuable. There are several emerging development tools that are making plumbing the IoT much simpler and quicker. One that is seeing great traction in the open source community is Node-RED . Tools like Node-RED make it easier to connect devices and plumb the IoT so organizations can spend less time on development and more time getting insight from IoT data.\nTransforming Transactions and Supply Chain Management Blockchain is beginning to play a major part in the Internet of Things by enhancing security, enabling inclusion of low-value devices to be increasingly viable and simplifying device management. Blockchain for IoT can optimize supply chains by tracking objects as they traverse the export/import supply chain while enforcing shipping and line of credit contracts and expediting incremental payments. Blockchain technology enables secure traceability of certifications and other salient information in supply chains. Provenance enables every physical product to come with a digital passport that proves authenticity and origin, creating an auditable record of the journey behind all physical products. Blockchain can also help with compliance by allowing companies to track equipment or process history in an indelible record and enable easy sharing of this information with regulatory agencies or insurers. Blockchain has the potential to vastly reduce the cost and complexity of operating businesses. It makes it easier to create cost-efficient business networks where virtually anything of value can be tracked and traded, without requiring a central point of control.\nGetting started with Blockchain is simple. IBM Blockchain gives you the ability to easily and quickly deploy a permissioned blockchain network to test security, availability and performance. Take your ideas and experiment with transactions and app development on your own blockchain network on Bluemix\nUnlocking the Value of IoT Data An exploding amount of IoT data requires a new approach to gather, analyze and makes sense out of all that data. Such a massive amount of information from sensors and devices can be used to enhance existing data and knowledge, uncovering insights capable of transforming industries. But although making sense out of dark data and edge data is paving our way to revolutionary ideas and technologies, it requires a new approach.\nCognitive IoT is just such an approach—a way of deciphering IoT data that can effectively handle increasingly large inputs while generating meaningful output. Programmable systems thrive on prescribed scenarios using predictable data, and their rigidity can limit their usefulness when addressing the ambiguity and uncertainty of IoT data. Cognitive systems, however, are not explicitly programmed. Rather, they learn from interactions with people and from experiences with their environment. In doing so, they become able to keep pace with the complexity of the Internet of things, identifying data correlations that would otherwise go unnoticed.\nCognitive IoT opens up a new realm of opportunities by enabling enterprises to combine streams of data in new ways and get deeper insights as a result. Cognitive IoT will enable us to combine all relevant data sets to solve problems in new ways.",

Data volumes are doubling every 2 years. Data complexity presents itself in two forms - Volume and Variety. The rise and proliferation of mobile apps, SaaS and on-premise applications, and IoT and M2M, the data has become one of the most important business factors. CIOs and IT decision makers have a compelling reason for developing hybrid, on-premise and cloud deployment models to ensure market leadership and competitive differentiation. The successful deployment of a hybrid model depends on the effectiveness of the data integration and its capability to flexibly provide meaningful data across the correct channel. The emergence of hybrid deployments as the preferred approach for integrations compels IT leaders to look at increased convergence of data and application integration. Cloud is a strategic stop in this evolutionary path. Coupled with this is the fact that the nearing end of the cycle of ETL and ESB technologies. Both these are increasingly losing relevance in the cloud era, where the rise of mobility, social, data and analytics necessitates new approaches to solve challenges from data and app integrations. Typical front-office applications have migrated to the cloud. Application categories, platforms, analytics and architecture are increasingly being transitioned to the cloud. All this points to iPaaS as the go to solution to enable enterprise to ease this transition and put enterprises on the desired path towards digital transformation. The elimination and reduction of legacy systems brings two key aspects - cost savings and technical prowess. Beyond efficient integrations, the elimination of integration middleware is a big plus for both the enterprise and SMB segment. iPaaS solutions entail lower upfront costs coupled with the ability to perform faster and automated deployments. The integrations built through iPaaS will empower businesses with the necessary scale, flexibility and control for the future. iPaaS is a key accelerating force towards the integration of cloud and on-premise systems. the worldwide iPaaS market to reach $2.15 billion in 2021.

      "title": "4 Key Sessions From Barcelona’s Gartner Symposium",
      "text": "Written by Lisa Peyton Fagg | November 18, 2016 4 Key Sessions From Barcelona’s Gartner Symposium November 18, 2016 \nThousands of CIOs and IT decision-makers gathered at the Gartner Symposium/ITxpo in Barcelona last week to learn more about Gartner’s take on the future of IT. \nThe event theme was \"Lead 360: Drive Digital to the Core.\" The focus was on making digital technology the heart of businesses. Session speakers discussed the potential for new technologies to expand business opportunities, such as autonomous driving and the Internet of Things (IoT), including how these devices can drive business optimization through increased analytics. Naturally, with advancement in IoT devices, concerns about security in the digital age were a frequent topic of discussion. \nPeter Sondergaard Gartner’s SVP and Global Head of Research, outlined in his keynote guidance across four areas to evolve into a digital business: Modernize IT Systems Use virtual and augmented reality to engage customers Build a connected infrastructure to embrace IoT and connected devices APIs are critical to implementing business policies in a digital world \nI attended several key sessions that covered some of Sondergaard’s areas of focus and I’ve highlighted the ones that stood out to me on IT thought leadership. Enjoy! 1. Exponential Organizations: How to Navigate Disruption \nSalim Ismail believes that companies who aren't planning for the 21st century won't be around in the future. He spoke to the exponential advances in disruptive technological innovation requiring a new way of doing business, praising smaller companies for their ability to be agile in how they embrace new technology. \nIsmail outlined a proven formula he believes has guided companies that are successfully navigating the disruptive landscape. The formula, which he expounds upon in his book \"Exponential Organizations\" , includes: A Massive Transformative Purpose S.C.A.L.E. (Staff on demand, community and crowd, algorithms, leveraged assets, and engagement) I.D.E.A.S. (Interface processes, dashboards, experimentation, autonomy, and social technologies) \nA cursory view of these formulas focuses on how transforming leadership by updating their mindset and education is key. Inspiring change at the edges via change-makers and investing and partnering with adjacent innovative companies are two other methods. If you can assess strengths and weaknesses to optimize what your company does well, then you can revise or cut what you don't excel at to successfully navigate the disruptive landscape ahead. \nDoes your company support the ideals and processes of I.D.E.A.S and S.C.A.L.E? What would it take to make the change required to adopt them? 2. Security 2020: The Future of Cybersecurity \nHosted by Gartner’s research director, John A. Wheeler , Wheeler tackled the increase of cybersecurity and need for risk management technologies. One of the most poignant assessments was employees may unknowlingly pose the greatest threat to security. Evolving culture driven by leadershi p can allow end users the ability to use security approaches that best work for them, which builds personal accountability and ups security. By assessing risk and building the proper culture, businesses can increase their security. 3. Intel: 3 Steps to Making a Digital Workplace a Reality \nThe first of two Intel sessions, hosted by Vice President of the Client Computing Group and General Manager of the Business Client Platforms Division Tom Garrison , tackled the evolution of the workplace. As more work goes mobile, the ways we collaborate must adapt without opening vulnerabilities to cyber attacks. Intel has a three-part approach for added mobility with increased security that we presented to attendees. 4. Microsoft: Accelerating Digital Transformation \nMicrosoft Cloud Platform Product Marketing VP Julia White presented case studies on how brands have thrived by leaning into the advancement of digital technology. She pushed a few key ideas: engage customers, empower employees, optimize operations, and transform products. Carlsberg Beer, for example, empowered employees and achieved greater collaboration between their global product team and their global distribution team by using Microsoft’s planner tool in Office 365. \nI would like to thank Intel for sending me to the conference, as well as Gartner for putting together such an amazing array of speakers. If you missed the event in Barcelona, there will be another Gartner event in Las Vegas at the end of this month. Intel will be attending Gartner’s Identity and Access Management Summit , which will focus on reimagining IAM to optimize and accelerate digital business. \nMake sure to follow @IntelITCenter for updates and highlights throughout the event.

      "text": "18 Nov 2016 CEVA & NextG-Com partner on integrated LTE Cat-M1 & Cat-NB1 solutions \nCEVA has introduced two pre-integrated narrowband LTE solutions designed to simplify the development of Cat-M1 and Cat-NB1 (NB-IoT) modems for cost-sensitive Internet of Things (IoT) applications. \nThe solutions incorporate the recently introduced CEVA-X1 single-core IoT processor together with NextG-Com’s ALPSLite-M Cat-M1 or ALPSLite-NB Cat-NB1 protocol stacks, in a highly compact and power-efficient manner. Addressing the cost-sensitive nature of cellular IoT devices, the CEVA-X1 is capable of handling the full DSP and CPU processing loads for these modems, eliminating the requirement for a CPU controller in the system. Furthermore, the solutions have been carefully optimized to ensure smallest memory footprint, minimizing the requirements for costly embedded flash and static RAM. \nEnsuring maximum power efficiency for long life cellular IoT applications such as asset trackers or smart meters, the CEVA-X1 incorporates dedicated NB-IoT instructions, allowing it to operate at a clock speed of less than 100MHz for a complete Cat-NB1 solution. \n“Cellular IoT offers huge potential in terms of the breadth of applications it will enable and the massive global scale on which these devices can be deployed,” said Denis Bidinost, Chief Executive Officer of NextG-Com. “Our partnership with CEVA brings together their dedicated IoT processor with fully-optimized implementations of our Cat-M1 and Cat-NB1 protocol stacks to significantly simplify the integration of narrowband LTE connectivity into cost-sensitive, power-optimized IoT product designs.” \n“At CEVA, we’re at the forefront of LTE and 5G modem innovation, and the only end-to-end DSP supplier for cellular in the industry today, said Michael Boukaya, vice president and general manager, Wireless Business Unit at CEVA. “With the recent introduction of our single-core CEVA-X1 IoT processor, we leveraged this expertise to address the cellular IoT space and help drive this technology forward. Together with NextG-Com, we can offer our customers pre-integrated, dedicated solutions for low data rate LTE connectivity in any IoT device, from asset trackers through to wearalone wearables.”   Cellular telecoms",

      "text": "\nTechCrunch Tokyo 2016 wrapped up yesterday with a startup pitch battle featuring six upcoming Japanese companies. This year, 114 startups were whittled down to 20 contenders before the final six were selected to present yesterday.\nCheck out the winners in pitching order below.\nRefcome by Combinator (IBM BlueHub award) Founder and CEO of Combinator Takumi Shimizu.\nRefcome is a referral hiring system.\nLarge Japanese companies traditionally hire new graduates in large blocks after the school year ends in spring, but a few notable companies like Yahoo are bucking that trend.\nRefcome hopes to help businesses keep track of applicants and make it easier for employees to recommend prospects. One company claims to have cut hiring costs from around US$13,000 to US$1,800 by switching to the service.\nOther options like social recruiting tool Wantedly and BizReach exist but Refcome is off to a good start.\nSince its launch four months ago, there have been 160 referrals and 35 companies have signed up with an average size of 800 employees. Founder and CEO Takumi Shimizu says monthly recurring revenue is already near US$13,000.\nSyounika Online by KidsPublic (First place) CEO Naoya Hashimoto taking home the top prize.\nSyounika Online (Pediatrician Online) connects concerned parents with a licensed pediatrician.\nFor around US$40 per month parents can contact a doctor between 6pm and 10pm on weekdays through the phone, Skype, or messaging app Line. Currently 23 licensed pediatricians help with inquiries.\nAlthough Syounika Online took first place, judges were concerned about the definition of medical consultation. Founder and CEO Naoya Hashimoto is not worried and states that there is no set law for what can be done remotely and that regulation only restricts giving a diagnosis. Of the 100 times the service has been used, parents were suggested to go to the hospital for treatment three times.\nInitial data shows that users spend around US$30 per consultation at a cost of around US$15 to the business.\nDiggle by Tashi Knowledge (Fujitsu MetaArc award) Diggle fielding questions from the judges.\nDiggle wants to be the QuickBooks of Japan.\nThe founder spent three years at a large company before moving to a startup where he experienced the difficulties of trying to create a budget with Excel. He founded Diggle to help the 85 percent of small businesses in a similar situation.\nWith Diggle businesses can keep track of finances as well as make simulations and create different segments without writing formulas in individual spreadsheet cells.\nThe service has not launched yet, but the team is hoping to charge US$500 to US$1000 per company and eventually use APIs to bring in data from other accounting software.\nTown Wifi (Special judges’ award) Accepting the special judges’ award.\nTown Wifi gives access to 200,000 free wifi spots across Japan with a single application.\nAfter users install the app they can automatically connect to different public wifi services without entering a password. The team sees their service as a way to liberate young, video content loving consumers who frequently hit data limits.\nThe service launched in Korea this month with 10,000 access points and plans to expand to 30 countries by the end of 2017. Monetization will come from paid extra services in the future or possibly advertising.\nScouter (PR Times award) CEO Taro Nakajima of Scouter.\nScouter is a social headhunting service.\nAnyone can become a recruiter and introduce potential candidates to companies. Since April of this year 2,400 people have applied for headhunting positions and 600 companies have registered.\nThere are many rules and fees to become a recruiting company in Japan but Scouter acts as the registered firm and headhunters technically work for it part-time. The scouters are paid roughly US$10 per hour and receive 5 percent of the first year’s salary if a prospect takes a job. Scouter takes a 20 to 30 percent cut.\nCEO Taro Nakajima claims companies can cut their recruiting costs by 93 percent as compared to hiring through a traditional agency.\nFolio (AWS award) Folio’s CEO Shinichiro Kai taking questions from the judges.\nFolio is a motif investment service.\nFolio wants to help people invest in stocks, but the idea can be intimidating for newcomers. Instead of looking at individual companies, users can invest by choosing themes such as Internet of Things (IoT) or even actresses.\nFolio will pick stocks related to that theme (in the case of the actress it picks the company making the star’s commercial for example) and create a single basket of assets which users can buy with one click.\nThe service is waiting for a brokerage license before an expected launch at the end of this year.\nThis post 6 of Japan’s hottest startups battle out at TechCrunch Tokyo 2016 appeared first on Tech in Asia.\n",

      "text": "Intel Launches Nervana Artificial Intelligence Platform YOU ARE HERE: HOME \nBy Jef Cozza . Updated November 18, 2016 9:19AM SHARE Technology News Tech giant Intel has announced a new strategy focused on artificial intelligence (AI) and based on a new portfolio of technologies centered on its recent acquisition of AI company Nervana Systems. The new portfolio will include products and services for everything from network edge to data center use cases to help accelerate the growth of AI technologies. \n“Intel sees AI transforming the way businesses operate and how people engage with the world,” the company said in a statement yesterday. “Intel is assembling the broadest set of technology options to drive AI capabilities in everything from smart factories and drones to sports, fraud detection and autonomous cars.” \nAchieving Nervana \nDubbed Intel Nervana, the new platform comes courtesy of the company’s acquisition of the two-year-old Nervana Systems announced three months ago. The platform will be optimized for AI workloads with an emphasis on both speed and ease of use. \nThe first product in the platform, a chip codenamed “Lake Crest,\" will begin testing in the first half of next year and will eventually be available to key customers later that year, according to Intel. Lake Crest is optimized specifically for neural networks to deliver the high performance for deep learning, the company said. \nMeanwhile, Intel also announced plans for a new product codenamed “Knights Crest\" that will integrate its existing Xeon processors with AI technology from Nervana. \n“We expect the Intel Nervana platform to produce breakthrough performance and dramatic reductions in the time to train complex neural networks,” said Diane Bryant, executive vice president and general manager of Intel's data center croup, in the statement. “Before the end of the decade, Intel will deliver a 100-fold increase in performance that will turbocharge the pace of innovation in the emerging deep learning space.” \nNew AI Developer Academy \nThe company also highlighted its plans for other AI assets, including Intel Saffron Technology, a business insights platform that leverages memory-based reasoning techniques and transparent analysis of heterogeneous data. Intel said the technology is also particularly well-suited to small devices, making intelligent local analytics possible across Internet of Things devices and helping advance state-of the-art collaborative AI. \nIntel also announced a strategic alliance with Google to help enterprise IT deliver an open, flexible and secure multi-cloud infrastructure for their businesses. The collaboration includes technology integrations focused on Kubernetes containers, machine learning, security, and IoT. \nTo support development of products for AI technology, the company also announced the launch of the Intel Nervana AI Academy to provide access to training and tools for software developers. It also introduced the Intel Nervana Graph Compiler tool to help accelerate deep learning frameworks on Intel hardware. \n“Intel is committed to AI and is making major investments across technology, training, resources and R&D to advance AI for business and society,” Intel CEO Brian Krzanich said in a blog post. “Our goal is to compress the innovation cycle from conception to the deployment of increasingly intelligent, robust and collaborative machines.”  ",

      "text": "PC Matic’s Vice President of Cyber Security, Dodi Glenn, recently conducted a webinar regarding how to strengthen cyber security infrastructures with an automated global whitelist approach. During the webinar, Dodi discussed the current threat landscape, malware sample manipulation, and preventative detection with application whitelisting.\nDodi shared with the audience the malware trends, and his thoughts on future cyber security threats. This included threats facing the Internet of Things (IoT) and a continued increase in ransomware attacks.\nHe also shared how easy it is for cyber criminals to obtain a code of malware, and make the slightest alterations to it in order to avoid detection by traditional blacklist protection.\nFeel free to listen in on the recorded version of this webinar now.\n\n \n  \nThe post Strengthening Cyber Security Infrastructure with Automated Global Whitelist appeared first on PC Pitstop TechTalk .\nRelated posts:\nAutomated Global Whitelist: Strengthening the Cybersecurity Infrastructure It’s time we start taking control of our endpoint security...

      "text": "3 Trends Driving IoT Innovation\nhttp://ift.tt/2fET4YL \nThe Internet of Things is transforming how we work and live in more ways than many of us could have imagined. Connecting things with unique IP addresses has been possible for over a decade, but the commoditization of sensors and processors and emerging technologies that further enable IoT possibilities are making it viable to move beyond being just connected, into an intelligent Internet of Things.\nGetting Smarter About Wiring the IoT One of the unique challenges of the Internet of Things is stepping into an object oriented world, and understanding how to link together so many disparate objects that speak different languages. The average IoT engineer is not interested in diving into the coding necessary to drive these interactions, they want to quickly be able to pull in operational data and glean new insights from it. This is where a tool that simplifies wiring together the IoT becomes incredibly valuable. There are several emerging development tools that are making plumbing the IoT much simpler and quicker. One that is seeing great traction in the open source community is Node-RED . Tools like Node-RED make it easier to connect devices and plumb the IoT so organizations can spend less time on development and more time getting insight from IoT data.\njava\nvia DZone.com Feed https://dzone.com \nNovember 19, 2016 at 06:45AM",

      "text": "Share Save The connected car is not an entirely new invention. We've been syncing our cars to our phones through Bluetooth, accessing GPS navigation, and even getting directions through 3G connected applications. But connecting otherwise utilitarian appliances to the internet is a growing trend, and vehicles are the next industry that's on the verge of revitalization. Let's take a look at some of the major changes coming our way. Internet Integration As of now, most connected vehicles are using proprietary systems. Vehicle manufacturers are attempting to keep users within their own ecosystem, but this restricts the availability of information to consumers. Research done by Gartner suggests that in the next four years, over 250 million vehicles will have full internet access. This means that drivers will no longer be restricted to proprietary information systems, allowing them to communicate with any other device on the internet or in their own personal network. Luxury Vehicle Improvements Chances are, the first place we'll start to see IoT integration will be in the luxury automobile market. Luxury vehicles are often sold with the most advanced, cutting-edge technology of the time, and consumers are willing to pay for it. We're already starting IoT integration in many luxury limo services , showing that there is a clear market for people who want this type of technology in their vehicles. Another company that's already begun integrating their vehicles with IoT technology is Tesla Motors. They recently demonstrated a system which is designed to fix vehicle issues over the air, saving consumers a trip to the service station. Remote Support Tesla has demonstrated one of the most well received, and possibly the most useful, application of IoT technology . As our vehicles are increasingly automated and software was driven, there needs to be a system that allows support networks to access our vehicles at all times. This technology could allow repair shops to access vehicle diagnostic information, identifying small issues before they turn into major mechanical problems. If your car seems to be running a little oddly, the IoT will mean that you can identify these issues with a touch of a button. Connected Transport One of the essential functions in our society is the ability to transport goods. Every year, millions of miles are driven by transport drivers, and we've established several networks designed to use vehicles to get items from one place to another. IoT is the glue that will eventually network all of these systems together . We'll be able to better coordinate deliveries across a wide variety of channels, and help route packages in the most efficient manner. For most of us, this means less crowding on the roads and quicker delivery of our mail. The Technology is Already Here Some of these concepts might seem futuristic and far-fetched, but we already have all of the technology to make this happen. In fact, Intel is leading the pack in IoT technology for transport with their sensors and processors. While it might take a few years for this technology to show up in basic consumer cars, companies like Tesla who have been known to cater to the gadget fans may speed this up. This is just another example of how existing technology can be used to improve our lives in ways we never thought possible. 0 Shares ",

      "text": "New IoT Security Guidelines Issued by DHS New IoT Security Guidelines Issued by DHS 0 0 the post is also available in: Hebrew :הכתבה זמינה גם ב \nA set of strategic principles was issued by the US Department of Homeland Security regarding Internet of Things (IoT) security. The guidelines promote transparency between IoT manufacturers, service providers and consumers through “coordinated disclosure of vulnerabilities.” “Securing the Iot has become a matter of homeland security”, said a DHS statement. Connected technologies encompass many aspects, from self-driving cars to control systems that deliver water and power. \nThe DHS stressed that manufacturers have their own role to play in IoT security by incorporating it into the design phase, advancing security updates and vulnerability management, and prioritizing security measures according to potential impact. \n“Failing to design and implement adequate security measures could be damaging to the manufacturer in terms of financial costs, reputational costs or product recall costs,” the DHS said in its guidelines. “While there is not yet an established body of case law addressing IoT context, traditional tort principles of product liability can be expected to apply.” \nThe DHS said that its principles were designed not only for IoT manufacturers, but also for IoT developers, industrial and business-level consumers, and service providers who implement services through devices. \nThe agency also noted that focusing on security as a feature of IoT gives manufacturers and service providers an opportunity for market differentiation. \nThe DHS also stressed the significance of maintaining transparency across the Internet of Things, stating that developers and manufacturers need to know their supply chain, including what their hardware and software components are and if there are any vulnerabilities. \nOn the consumer end, the DHS advised that customers connect their IoT devices carefully and deliberately: “IoT consumers, particularly in the industrial context, should deliberately consider whether continuous connectivity is needed given the use of the IoT device and the risks associated with its disruption.” \nM.CRN.com cites Luis Alvarez, president and CEO of Alvarez Technology Group, a solution provider, saying that recognizing the security weaknesses in IoT devices is a good start but more needs to be done to ensure that manufacturers and developers keep security top of mind. “To be sure, it’s great that the government recognizes that there is a huge security weakness in the current development of IoT technologies and those vulnerabilities can and will present problems to our nation,” he said. “The challenge, of course, is that as it currently stands ‘security’ is optional and until that changes, IoT developers will take the path of least resistance to get a minimally viable product out to the market. The DHS guidelines don’t really offer any revolutionary insights and are more a set of best practices that will be familiar to any security professional.” \nAssistant Secretary for Cyber Policy Robert Silvers said in the DHS statement: “Today is a first step. We have a rapidly closing window to ensure security is accounted for at the front end of the Internet of Things phenomenon. These principles will initiate longer-term collaboration between government and industry. Together we will work to develop solutions to address the resilience of the Internet of Things so that we can continue to benefit from the remarkable innovation that is driving our increasingly-connected world.”",

      "title": "Samsung, Microsoft Partner to Bring More Apps to the Tizen OS Platform",
      "text": "\nSamsung recently made a major commitment towards its operating system Tizen as the company announced 'First Global Tizen Mobile App Incentive Program' to encourage developers to make apps for the OS. It came across as a huge surprise as since its release in 2012, this was the first major incentive programme to bring more apps to the OS by the South Korean company. Now, Samsung has partnered with Microsoft to ensure that no stones are left unturned.\nOn Thursday, Samsung announced its partnership with Microsoft on open source projects such as such as .NET Core and Xamarin.Forms, in order to enable .NET support for Tizen. This effectively means that from now on, developers will be able to make use of Microsoft's Visual Studio and make apps for Tizen using the C# language. Samsung has already released the first preview of the Visual Studio tools for Tizen that will help .NET developers to Tizen apps for smart TVs, wearables such as the Gear S3, smartphones, and Internet of Things devices. \"The first preview supports mobile application development with device emulators and an extension to Visual Studio with full IntelliSense and debugging capabilities. Support for Smart TVs, wearables, and other IoT devices will be added in future releases,\" the company said in its announcement. Tizen's .NET support will officially be released and start shipping on Samsung devices, including smart TVs, in 2017, the company said. \"Samsung is excited to be a part of the .NET community. .NET has an extensive developer base and great potential,\" Samsung's Executive Vice President and Deputy Head of Software R&D Center Seung-hwan Cho was quoted as saying by the company. \"Through thoughtful and progressive collaboration with Microsoft, Samsung is expecting to create unique development experiences for both Tizen and C# developers, enriching the Tizen ecosystem,\" Cho said.",

      "text": "Exabeam Selected as SC Media 2017 Excellence Award Finalist For Best Emerging Technology SAN MATEO, CA--(Marketwired - Nov 18, 2016) - Exabeam , the leader in user and entity behavior analytics (UEBA) for security, has been named a finalist in the Best Emerging Technology Excellence Award category for the 2017 SC Awards. Finalists are recognized for outstanding leadership and providing superior security products to the cybersecurity industry. Winners will be announced at the SC Awards 2017 ceremony to be held February 14, 2017 in San Francisco.\nExabeam's UEBA solution analyzes user and machine behavior using existing log, endpoint, and other data to quickly detect advanced attacks, prioritize incidents and guide effective response. Exabeam has helped companies across industries uncover attacks that are otherwise invisible to other security solutions.\n\"Ransomware, nation-state cyber attacks, IoT vulnerabilities, data privacy issues and more are dominating the headlines right now and it's critical that we amplify the importance of these problems and highlight the actions organizations can take to safeguard their organizations and their critical data assets,\" said Illena Armstrong, VP, editorial, SC Media. \"As bad actors are constantly changing strategy, so too are the men, women and companies endeavoring to stop them in their tracks. These finalists have shown that they are the best at what they do.\"\nThe SC Awards program, now in its 20th year, is recognized throughout the industry as the gold standard of excellence in cybersecurity. Winners in the Excellence category are determined by an expert panel of judges, hand-picked by SC Media's editorial team for their breadth of knowledge and experience in cybersecurity industry. The Excellence Award honors the professionals, products and services that have proven to be the best in the industry for protecting today's corporate world from an array of risks and threats.\n\"The biggest challenge for any CISO is the knowledge that there are threats and attacks hitting their organization that they can't see,\" said Nir Polak, CEO of Exabeam. \"Catching malicious insiders and identifying compromised credentials among the myriad alerts and incidents can overwhelm the already-burdened security analysts of most enterprises. Being a Best Emerging Technology finalist validates what we're hearing from customers: That Exabeam solves a critical problem cleanly and reduces workload so security analysts can focus on the highest risk incidents.\"\n\"It's been said that cybercriminals are often the earliest adopters of new technologies, creating a unique challenge for organizations trying to protect private and public sector companies from attacks,\" added Armstrong of SC Media. \"As a finalist, we recognize Exabeam as one of an elite group of companies able to successfully meet this constantly evolving challenge head-on.\"\nThe SC Awards gala honoring the winners and the best in the industry attracts top professionals in the cybersecurity community and provides an invaluable opportunity for networking.

The recent auto-update to iot-core 10.0.14393.448 failed to start installed background tasks which were cleanly registered and tested as startup tasks. These tasks have been running for weeks and are properly installed and tested to properly start after any shutdown or power-cycle. No problems there. Why is it that an auto-update to the iot-core cannot properly restart these tasks?This means that remote sites, once again, must have manual interventions. Still IoT without the \"I\".\nWhile I am at it, I will also vent the wide-spread frustration that there is no known way (lots of unanswered forum requests) to get a unique ID string for a given board (RPi in this case). This is then IoT without the \"T\".\nExcuse the steam, but these show stoppers have been around, and reported, for a long time...",

I report that an app which as been verifiably properly registered as a startup headless app, and has been working fine across reboots/power-cycles is suddenly not started after the iot-core auto update cycle.

      "text": "Asia Pacific share market finished mostly higher on last trading session of the week, Friday, 18 November 2016, on tracking strong rally on Wall Street overnight after Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen's hawkish comments. \nThe regional share market tracked a positive finish among major U.S indexes on Thursday on the back of remarks from Fed Chair Janet Yellen and upbeat economic data. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 35.68 points, or 0.19%, to close at 18,903.82. The S&P 500 gained 10.18 points, or 0.47%, to end at 2,187.12, while the Nasdaq composite advanced 39.39 points, or 0.74%, to 5,333.97. \nU.S. economic data showed housing starts soared more than 25% in October stateside, while weekly jobless claims dropped to their lowest level since November 1973. In October, the consumer price index rose 0.4%, which was in line with expectations. \nYellen has stressed the importance of central bank independence in her first public remarks after Donald Trump's election victory as new data showed the president-elect will inherit a strengthening economy. The Federal Reserve chair told a congressional hearing yesterday, 17 November 2016 that an increase in short-term interest rates could become appropriate relatively soon, raising expectations of a rise at the Fed's next meeting in December. \nShe added she would not step down from her position as the head of the Federal Reserve until the end of her term. Her comments pushed the dollar higher, with the dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of currencies, reaching a session high of 101.32. \nAmong Asian bourses \nAustralia Stocks end higher \nAustralian share market ended higher, on the back of strong rally on Wall Street overnight after Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen's hawkish comments. At the closing bell, the benchmark S&P/ASX 200 index rose 20.90 points, or 0.39%, to 5,359.40, while the broader All Ordinaries index increased 18.60 points, or 0.34%, to 5,427.50. \nFinancial stocks led gainers with Commonwealth Bank of Australia and Westpac Banking Corp, tacking on around 0.3%. \nTelecom stocks rallied as Telstra Corp rose 1.9%, bringing the week's gains to 4.5%, as investors reacted positively to news of big cost cuts over the next five years. \nMyer Holdings shares jumped as much as 10.6% as the retail giant flagged a return to profit in 2017 financial year after net income fell for the past six financial years. \nNikkei closes at 10-month high \nThe Japan share market closed at its highest level in more than 10 months, as risk appetite buying fuelled yen depreciation to 110 level against greenback on hopes for an interest rate hike by the U.S. Federal Reserve, after Fed Chair Janet Yellen firmly hinted at the possibility of a hike in December. The headline Nikkei 225 gained 0.59%, or 104.78 points, to end at 17,967.41, a whisker below the psychologically key 18,000 mark and its best level since early January. The broader Topix index of all first-section issues was up 0.38%, or 5.38 points, at 1,428.46. \nShares of export-oriented firms attracted buying on expectations for better earnings after dollar's jump above 110 yen against greenback, as many export-oriented Japanese firms set their assumed dollar rates at 100-105 yen. Among them were automakers Toyota, Honda and Mazda, as well as technologies Sony and Hitachi. Shipping firms Nippon Yusen, Kawasaki Kisen and Mitsui O.S.K. Lines advanced, after the Baltic Dry Index for shipping costs climbed for 11 sessions in a row. By contrast, megabank groups and insurers met with apparent profit-taking after the recent surge. They included Mitsubishi UFJ, Sumitomo Mitsui, Dai-ichi Life and Tokio Marine. Among other losers were drug manufacturer Astellas, mobile carrier NTT Docomo and retailer Seven & i Holdings. \nChina Stocks fall on capital outflow woes, stronger dollar \nMainland China stock market closed down for second straight session, on funds outflow worries after US Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen said the Fed could raise interest rates as soon as next month, which is expected to make emerging markets less attractive. Market heavyweights and financial stocks were hit worst, dragging down overall performance. The benchmark Shanghai Composite Index fell 0.5% to close at 3,192.86 points. The CSI 300 index closed 0.56% down at 3,417.46 points. \nA strong US dollar and worries over capital outflows also curbed investor appetites. With the dollar index still hovering near a 13-1/2 year high against a basket of currencies, there are persistent fears of yuan depreciation, as global investors continue to bet US President-elect Donald Trump's policies will result in higher inflation and stronger US economic growth. \nShanghai's property sub-index outperformed the broader market, following government data that showed average new home prices in China's 70 major cities rose 12.3% on-year in October, a faster pace than the 11.2% on-year rise in September. Among Property plays, with Shenzhen-listed shares of Vanke up 3.9% and Poly Real Estate climbing 1.83%, while Gemdale erased early gains to trade down 0.73%. \nHong Kong Stocks close up \nThe Hong Kong stock market closed up, buoyed by Wall Street rally overnight on rising expectations of a US rate hike next month Market talks indicated slim chances of the Shenzhen-HK Connect program launch on 21 November, and it may be delayed to December. The Hang Seng Index ended up 0.37%, or 81.33 points, to 22,344.21 and the Hang Seng China Enterprises index added 0.24%, or 22.77 points, to 9,349.31. Turnover decreased to HK$55.9 billion from HK$62.3 billion on Thursday. \nChairman of China Tower Corporation Liu Aili said he aims at an IPO by end-2017. China Mobile (00941) edged down 0.2% to HK$84.6. China Telecom (00728) gained 0.6% to HK$3.65. China Unicom (00762) put on 3.9% to HK$9.07. \nCKH Holdings (00001) climbed 1.4% to HK$94.9. The company yesterday bought back its own shares by HK$72.7 million. It was the first time of buyback since its restructuring. CK Property (01113) inched down 0.3% to HK$50.75. \nAAC Tech (02018) jumped 2.5% to HK$73.85 after the company expects its non-acoustic business revenues to exceed acoustic's in 2017. Sunny Optical (02382) shot up 5.8% to HK$41.25. \nEvergande (03333) added stake in China Vanke (02202) again. China Vanke soared 3.2% to HK$21.95, while Evergrande edged up 0.4% to HK$5.3. \nSensex extends recent losing streak \nMetal sector stocks and index heavyweights ITC, HDFC Bank and Infosys led small losses for key benchmark indices. The barometer index, the S&P BSE Sensex lost 77.38 points or 0.3% to settle at 26,150.24. The Nifty fell 5.85 points or 0.07% to settle at 8,074.10. The Sensex, and the Nifty, hit their lowest closing level in more than 5-1/2-months. \nStocks of public sector banks edged higher. Stocks of private sector banks were mixed. Index heavyweight Reliance Industries (RIL) nudged higher after the company announced the signing of a global partnership agreement in the Industrial IOT (IIOT) space whereby RIL and GE will work together to build out joint applications on GE's Predix platform. \nElsewhere in the Asia Pacific region: New Zealand's NZX50 added 0.6% to 6857.84. Indonesia's Jakarta Composite index fell 0.4% to 5170.11. Taiwan's Taiex added 0.2% to 9008.79. South Korea's KOSPI index declined 0.3% to 1974.58. Malaysia's KLCI was down 0.2% to 1623.80. Singapore's Straits Times index rose 0.9% to 2838.65. \n ",

      "title": "Industrial Embedded Systems – Market Trends and Forecasts from Technavio",
      "text": "Blog This \nTechnavio’s latest report on the global industrial embedded systems market provides an analysis on the most important trends expected to impact the market outlook from 2016-2020. Technavio defines an emerging trend as a factor that has the potential to significantly impact the market and contribute to its growth or decline. \nBharath Kanniappan, a lead analyst from Technavio, specializing in research on industrial automation sector, says, “ Industrial embedded systems are widely used in both process and discrete industries. Industries such as oil and gas , power , cement, chemical, and automotive , and pulp and paper, among others, have harsh operating conditions and require robust automation systems .” \nNew trends such as vision systems, multi-core processors, and power efficiency capabilities have further augmented the utility and scope of the industrial embedded hardware market. The latest developments in embedded hardware are the incorporation of embedded sensors in the form of nano blobs in materials used to build industrial robots, thus enabling the machines to achieve increased conductivity and superior sensitivity. Such attributes let robots safely interact with objects and human beings in industrial environments. Such developments are an impetus to the growing embedded hardware market. \nRequest a sample report: http://www.technavio.com/request-a-sample?report=54426 \nTechnavio’s sample reports are free of charge and contain multiple sections of the report including the market size and forecast, drivers, challenges, trends, and more. \nThe top three emerging trends driving the global industrial embedded systems marketaccording to Technavio automation research analysts are: Increased adoption of multi-core processors Rise of wireless connectivity Advancement of materials used in embedded systems \nIncreased adoption of multi-core processors \nEarlier, 8-bit microcontrollers were the most commonly used in industrial embedded systems such as motor control, industrial process control, actuators, sensors, and robotics. However, industrial technology has advanced to include complex capabilities such as wireless connectivity, imaging, and smart sensors, and this has propelled the demand for advanced and efficient algorithms. Hence, vendors are designing single chips with multiple cores to enhance applications, increase reliability, reduce power consumption, and lower overall operational costs. \n“ The Compact RIO industrial embedded controller from National Instruments has a dual core processor which has enabled the integration of latest technologies such as Xilinx Kintex 7 FPGAs and 64-bit Intel Atom E3800 SoC ,” according to Bharath. \nRise of wireless connectivity \nIoT enables prompt collection, storage, and transmission of data, which allows rapid analysis and decision making by experts across international borders. Recent developments in sensor technologies (such as wireless sensor nodes) can be integrated with wireless networking protocols like ZigBee and Wi-Fi. Previously industrial embedded systems were operating as stand-online systems. Currently, due to the high demand of IoT and wireless protocols including near field communications and long range protocols in various industries, industrial embedded systems are adopting wireless SoC architecture. \nWireless connectivity in industrial embedded systems has enabled Internet connectivity and subsequently increased the market prospects of industrial embedded systems during the forecast period. \nAdvancement of materials used in embedded systems \nPreviously sensors used in industries could collect and interpret information only at the point of contact between the sensor and the object. This is a major limiting factor in the use of industrial sensors. Hence newer materials are being developed which can incorporate multiple embedded technologies and augment the functioning of sensors. Using new composite materials such as ceramic hybrid polymers and polydimethylsiloxane, the lifespan of embedded systems remains unaffected as these materials redirect stress away from these electronic devices. \nBy successful incorporation of embedded systems in these materials and the use of finite-element-analysis (FEA) software, sensors can perform their function beyond the limits of the contact point by using analysis of predictive stress and strain patterns. These superior sensors can be utilized for effective and efficient predictive maintenance in various industries. \nThe key vendors are as follows: Atmel",

      "title": "Whitewood’s Entropy Engine Awarded R&D 100 Award for 2016",
      "text": "Blog This \nWhitewood, a developer of crypto-security solutions, announced that its Entropy Engine™, a quantum-powered, high-performance Random Number Generator capable of generating 350 Mbit/s of true random numbers, was honored with a 2016 R&D 100 Award. The award recognizes the top 100 technological advances of the past year, as determined by a panel selected by R&D Magazine, in the IT/Electrical category. Entropy Engine was also a finalist in the Special Recognition Market Disruptor Services categories. \n“We are thrilled that our Entropy Engine was selected as the winner for this prestigious award. It highlights the importance of improving random number generation, the very foundation of all forms of cryptography, across data centers and security infrastructure,” said Richard Moulds, Vice President of Strategy for Whitewood. “In developing the Entropy Engine, Whitewood works closely with our partners at Los Alamos National Laboratory to commercialize their initial research. The Entropy Engine illustrates the value of public-private partnerships in cybersecurity and an ability to bring additional protection to critical national infrastructure through such partnership.” \nMany applications and operating systems rely on random numbers. In particular, those applications that perform encryption, use digital signatures or employ other forms of cryptography use random numbers as the basis of their security. When random numbers are not truly random, keys can become more predictable and security measures such as SSL/TLS, PKI and data-at-rest encryption could become vulnerable to attack. The Entropy Engine aims to set a new benchmark for performance and security when generating random numbers. Designed as a convenient PCI express plug-in card for servers, the Entropy Engine exploits quantum mechanics to generate pure entropy and delivers true random numbers at speeds of up to 350 Mbit/s. The product is architected to comply with the latest draft NIST standard SP800-90B for entropy sources and non-deterministic random bit generators. \n“The Entropy Engine provides an excellent example of how a national laboratory and the private sector can combine their skills and resources to address real-world challenges,” said Los Alamos Chief Technology Officer Duncan McBranch. “Not only does the Entropy Engine benefit existing security applications today, it demonstrates potential to be an essential component of future quantum-safe systems. The technology shift due to quantum information and computing systems has been a long-term research focus at Los Alamos, and now with the Entropy Engine we are excited to see this technology in the marketplace.” \nIn addition to being provided as a standalone random number generator, the Entropy Engine also forms the heart of the Whitewood netRandom product that addresses the need for high quality entropy in distributed networks and applications. The widespread adoption of virtualization, migration to cloud computing, and the Internet of Things (IoT) all increase the challenge of capturing enough high-quality entropy. Deployed as a client-server solution, the netRandom product is designed to supply entropy across an entire datacenter or population of devices and enable existing systems to gain access to true random numbers without requiring modification to applications. \nFor more information, visit www.whitewoodencryption.com or email [email protected] . \nAbout Whitewood Whitewood® is addressing one of the most fundamental challenges associated with modern cryptosystems – random number generation and distribution. Whitewood’s products exploit quantum mechanics to meet demand for high-quality entropy used for random data and key generation at scale. Building upon a base of quantum cryptography capabilities developed over the course of the past two decades at Los Alamos National Laboratory, Whitewood addresses operational vulnerabilities in encryption and crypto applications across the datacenter, cloud and in mobile and embedded systems.

      "text": "  \nKUALA LUMPUR: With technological applications being at the forefront of the smart cities concept and in making cities more liveable, one may wonder about Malaysia’s smart city initiative. \nWe have heard a lot about partnerships between the private sector and government-linked companies this year, but does this mean Malaysia is moving ahead in its smart cities initiative, such as in the supporting infrastructure? \nAccording to Malaysia Digital Economy Corp (MDEC), Asia has been growing at between five and six per cent since 2010. \nAnd to support this annual growth, improvements in communications, energy, health, education, digital media and transport infrastructure are essential at this juncture. \nWith other developed nations being at the forefront of smart city initiatives, could Malaysia learn some lessons from their implementations? \nMDEC said the government was proactive and ready to invest in smart initiatives that would push the region forward. \n“With the proactive awareness on big data, companies can provide customers with the information and control they need to change their behavioural patterns and reduce usage and costs,” MDEC told Business Times recently. \nMDEC said one of Malaysia’s success stories was the joint collaboration with the United Kingdom in making urbanisation manageable and, most importantly, sustainable for the future. \n“Smart technologies will be essential towards achieving this. Both countries have taken a number of positive steps in rapidly developing relationships around smart cities, to help position each other as a leader in the provision of innovative solutions in Europe and Southeast Asia, respectively,” it said. \nMDEC infotech division vice-president Norhizam Abdul Kadir said there were three key initiatives that hade been moved forward by both the government and private sector in driving the formation of smart cities. \nHe said the Malaysia Technical Standards Forum Bhd had drafted a Smart Cities Framework in Relation to ICT Aspects (MTFSB 004-2016) — currently open for public feedback until December 4. \nThe second initiative was the partnership between MDEC and Malaysian Industry-Government Group for High Technology (MIGHT), where they jointly prepared a smart city framework for Malacca by developing the state’s green city action plan. \nBesides that, the country’s first integrated operations centre (IOC) for Internet of Things (IoT) operations of smart city services has been set up by Inneonusa Sdn Bhd, a joint venture between Telekom Malaysia Bhd (TM), UEM Sunrise and Iskandar Investment Bhd. \nThe challenge today is that smart cities might mean different things to different people, said Norhizam. \n“What’s important is what cities want to achieve at the end of the day: is it reducing crime, relieving the plight of the poor, attracting talents or ensuring a clean environment? \n“Technology is one of the means to get there. In some cases, technology may already be there, but it needed to be integrated with other systems to achieve the desired outcome,” he said. \nNorhizam said factors that were holding back this initiative were usually the existing policies or laws, resistance to change, and the silo mentality. \n“We all need to think holistically to make smart cities a reality in Malaysia,” he said. \nRecently, MIGHT was quoted in a New Straits Times report as saying Malaysia needed to consolidate its current set of disparate initiatives to develop smart cities and form a national smart city alliance to bring all interested parties together. \nMIGHT chief executive officer and president Datuk Dr Mohd Yusoff made the call at the Smart Cities Asia 2016 conference and exhibition, here, recently. \n“I think we should think about having a smart city alliance where you can deal with national and international inputs and feedbacks and I think this is urgently needed,” said Yusoff, pointing out that the different parties all had their own different ideas of what a smart city should be. \nNorhizam said the claim had its own merits. \n“For a relatively small country like Malaysia with limited resources, a centrally driven approach can optimise resources and ensure interoperability down the road. \n“The challenges are a rapidly changing socio-economic and technology environment, and resistance to change from stakeholders,” he said. \nNorhizam said MDEC believed the centrally-driven approach must still be pursued, but with the states or an agglomeration of municipals allowed some degrees of freedom to pursue their own projects. \n“This can accelerate the pace of ‘digital transformation’ for cities,” he said. \nHaving one template that could guide the advancement of technology is needed to help build the nation together. \n“At its core, inter-agency collaboration holds the promise of accomplishing something jointly that one agency alone cannot accomplish,” he said. \nIn terms of investment, Norhizam said the size of investment varied widely, depending on the degree of risk each city was willing to undertake. \n“What is more important is to start small, fail fast, and scale. Identify the key pain points that need resolution. Define a problem well, and you would have solved half of it already. \n“While an open innovation approach sounds sexy, proper programme and project management skills must be available to ensure implementation is done properly and future-proofed to the best extent,” he said. \nDespite the challenges, Norhizam said Malaysia was poised to ride the wave of smart city implementation. \n“Comparing our position with other more developed ones, countries like China with a top-down, centrally driven approach appear to be making fast progress. \n“In the case of a rapidly evolving environment, being late may have its advantages as we can then leapfrog with newer technologies, while learning from the lessons of others,” he said. \nIn terms of the supporting infrastructure and IoT, Norhizam said countries like Malaysia had enough of these resources, with data and technology getting more affordable as it continued to evolve. \n“Technology today is converging, and no one single vendor can do it all. \n“The role of the system integrator is pivotal to drive more implementations, and Malaysia has traditional strengths in systems integration,” he said.",

      "text": "  discusses cybersecurity and the devices that are most vulnerable to attack. \nSilicon Republic reported that “new research suggests that, ironically, it’s the ones that are supposed to ensure our personal security” that are most at risk. Last year there was a cyber attack by the Mirai botnet on websites, which “was a wake-up call for those invested n the IoT”, and which emphasised how one weakness could “unleash cyberattacks on an unprecedented scale”. \nThe articles asked which devices were most “vulnerable,” and is there anything to make them safer, and posed the question to Zscaler, a cloud security company. The company analysed the “types of devices in use” and also looked at the “protocols they used”, along with the “locations of servers” that they were connected to, integrating both “inbound and outbound communication over a two-month period”. \nThe collection of this data would ascertain whether they posed a threat to the owners of devices ,and show whether or not they had any part in the Mirai botnet used against the company Dyn last year. The result of the research was that the most “affected IoT devices are personal security cameras”, and this is due to the fact that they use “plain text HTTP protocol for authentication”, which means that they are susceptible to malware and hacker attacks. \nSome of the cameras had “poorly-encrypted communications and firmware updates” as well as insecure user data. Some of the network video recorders (NVR) used in security were discovered to have “weak default credentials”, namely the VideoEdge NVR and D-Link DNR 2021. Other devices that were vulnerable included a Fuji Xerox printer that “connected to maintenance logging modules without any authentication”: however, a Google Chromecast and the Roku streaming TV player were secure from potential attacks. \nA spokesman from Zscaler said: “IoT devices present a unique threat, because of their minimal security and their sheer numbers. The Mirai malware has shown us how these devices can wreak widespread havoc through targeted DDoS attacks.” \nZscaler recommended that companies “restrict IoT devices as much as possible from external networks”, and make sure the default credentials were changed to more secure information.",

I have attended the RAF Presentation and the Filter Interview (applying for Pers Spt) to date so I am happy to give advice wherever possible.\nFinally anyone who stumbles upon this who is also at a similar stage of the process, get in touch and hopefully we will bump heads in the not-so-distance future.\nQuick question, I am applying for WsOP which is obviously SNCO, i'm presuming i wont need to know about IOT as I will not be doing it?\nThanks",

      "text": "0 157 \nS amsung Electronics (KRX: 005930) (“Samsung”) and Harman International Industries, Incorporated (NYSE: HAR) (“HARMAN”) have announced that they have entered into a definitive agreement under which Samsung will acquire HARMAN for $112.00 per share in cash, or total equity value of approximately $8.0 billion. Upon closing, the transaction will immediately give Samsung a significant presence in the large and rapidly growing market for connected technologies, particularly automotive electronics, which has been a strategic priority for Samsung, and is expected to grow to more than $100 billion by 2025[1]. HARMAN is the market leader in connected car solutions, with more than 30 million vehicles currently equipped with its connected car and audio systems, including embedded infotainment, telematics, connected safety and security. Approximately 65% of HARMAN’s $7.0 billion of reported sales during the 12 months ended September 30, 2016 are automotive-related, and its order backlog for this market at June 30, 2016 was approximately $24 billion. \nHARMAN’s experience designing and integrating sophisticated in-vehicle technologies, as well as its long-term relationships with most of the world’s largest automakers, will create significant growth opportunities for the combined business by enabling it to leverage Samsung’s expertise in connected mobility, semiconductors, user experience, displays and its global distribution channels. In addition, the combination of HARMAN’s brands and audio capabilities and Samsung’s expertise in consumer electronics will deliver enhanced customer benefits and elevate user experiences across Samsung’s complete portfolio of consumer and professional products and systems. \n“HARMAN perfectly complements Samsung in terms of technologies, products and solutions, and joining forces is a natural extension of the automotive strategy we have been pursuing for some time,” said Oh-Hyun Kwon, Vice Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Samsung Electronics. “As a Tier 1 automotive supplier with deep customer relationships, strong brands, leading technology and a recognized portfolio of best-in-class products, HARMAN immediately establishes a strong foundation for Samsung to grow our automotive platform. Dinesh Paliwal is a proven global leader and, in our extensive discussions, we have developed deep respect for him, his strong senior leadership team and HARMAN’s talented employees. HARMAN’s sustained track record of rapid growth fueled by technology leadership and an unmatched automotive order pipeline reflects its commitment to innovation and customers.” \n“The vehicle of tomorrow will be transformed by smart technology and connectivity in the same way that simple feature phones have become sophisticated smart devices over the past decade,” added Young Sohn, President and Chief Strategy Officer of Samsung Electronics. “We see substantial long-term growth opportunities in the auto technology market as demand for Samsung’s specialized electronic components and solutions continues to grow. Working together, we are confident that HARMAN can become a new kind of Tier 1 provider to the OEMs by delivering end-to-end solutions across the connected ecosystem.” \nDinesh Paliwal, HARMAN Chairman, President and CEO, stated, “This compelling all-cash transaction will deliver significant and immediate value to our shareholders and provide new opportunities for our employees as part of a larger, more diversified company. Today’s announcement is a testament to what we have achieved and the value that we have created for shareholders. Samsung is an ideal partner for HARMAN and this transaction will provide tremendous benefits to our automotive customers and consumers around the world. Combining Samsung’s strengths in leading-edge displays, connectivity and processing solutions with HARMAN’s technology leadership and long-standing customer relationships will enable OEMs to provide new offerings for their customers. Partnerships and scale are essential to winning over the long term in automotive as demand for robust connected car and autonomous driving solutions increases at a rapid pace. This transaction will bring HARMAN and Samsung’s complementary strengths together to accelerate innovation in this space. More broadly, this investment underscores the strength of HARMAN’s employees, as well as our success and leadership across our markets. We look forward to working together with Samsung to elevate experiences for consumers worldwide.” \nCustomer Benefits and Significant Growth Opportunities Samsung expects the combination to deliver significant growth opportunities and benefits to customers by leveraging Samsung’s and HARMAN’s complementary technologies, resulting in increased market penetration across important end markets. \nAutomotive: Combining HARMAN’s leadership in new connected car technologies, including its top positions in infotainment, cyber security, over-the-air updates and telematics, with Samsung’s significant expertise and experience in connectivity technologies, including 5G, UX/UI, display technology and security solutions, will enhance HARMAN’s automotive and connected services businesses to drive greater sales and provide significant benefits as automakers speed the adoption of next-generation connected cars. \nAudio: HARMAN’s leading brands and cutting-edge audio systems include JBL®, Harman Kardon®, Mark Levinson®, AKG®, Lexicon®, Infinity®, and Revel®. The company also licenses Bowers & Wilkins® and Bang & Olufsen® brands for automotive. All of these brands will greatly enhance the competitiveness of Samsung’s mobile, display, virtual reality and wearable products to deliver a fully differentiated audio and visual experience for customers. \nProfessional: The combination will also expand the combined company’s business-to-business platform through its ability to deliver integrated, large-scale audio and visual professional solutions at stadiums, concert facilities and other performance centers such as The John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts and STAPLES Center – home of the GRAMMY Awards®. \nConnected Services: Samsung will gain access to HARMAN’s 8,000 software designers and engineers who are unlocking the potential of the IoT market. This collaboration will deliver the next generation of cloud-based consumer and enterprise experiences, as well as end-to-end services for the automotive market through the convergence of design, data and devices. \nOperating Structure and Leadership Upon closing, HARMAN will operate as a standalone Samsung subsidiary, and continue to be led by Dinesh Paliwal and HARMAN’s current management team. Samsung is pursuing a long-term growth strategy in automotive electronics, and plans to retain HARMAN’s work force, headquarters and facilities, as well as all of its consumer and professional audio brands. Samsung believes the combination will increase career development and advancement opportunities for the employees of both companies. \nSamsung’s Automotive Electronics Business Team, which was established in December of 2015 to identify opportunities for Samsung in the automotive sector, will work closely with the HARMAN management team to realize the full growth potential of the combination. \nTerms of the Transaction The purchase price represents a premium of 28% based on HARMAN’s closing stock price on November 11, 2016 and a 37% premium to HARMAN’s 30-calendar day volume weighted average price ending November 11, 2016. Samsung expects to use cash on hand to fund the transaction. The agreement has been unanimously approved by the boards of directors of both companies. \nThe transaction, which is subject to approval by HARMAN shareholders, regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions, is expected to close in mid-2017. \nAdvisors Evercore is serving as financial advisor to Samsung and Paul Hastings LLP is acting as legal counsel. J.P. Morgan and Lazard are serving as financial advisors to HARMAN and Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz is acting as legal counsel. ",

      "title": "Intel Launches Products for Artificial Intelligence Growth",
      "text": "Intel Launches Products for Artificial Intelligence Growth by Zacks Equity Research Published on November 18, 2016 Trades from $ 3 \nIntel Corporation ( INTC - Free Report ) is gearing up to become a major provider of solutions for the Artificial Intelligence (AI) market, which is anticipated to be worth $5.05 billion by 2020 as per MarketsAndMarkets.com. The company recently announced a plethora of products, technologies and investments, which will augment its presence in the AI market. AI Techniques Gain Adoption AI techniques like machine learning, deep learning and natural language processing (NLP) have been used by companies like Alphabet ( GOOGL - Free Report ) , Facebook, IBM and Microsoft to develop computer systems that can translate text into different languages and recognize objects in pictures.Apple’s Siri, Microsoft’s Cortana, Amazon’s Alexa virtual personal assistants, IBM’s Watson, and Google-DeepMind’s AlphaGo program are some of the prime examples of the usage of AI techniques. Further, popular applications like Netflix and Pandora rely on AI algorithms to recommend program contents to their users.AI techniques have gained immense traction over the last couple of years due to massive demand for analysing unstructured data like tweets, social media posts, photos and videos. The availability of powerful Graphic Processor Units (GPUs) from the likes of NVIDIA ( NVDA - Free Report ) and Advanced Micro Devices ( AMD - Free Report ) made parallel processing much faster and cheaper. Intel Integrates Xeon and Nervana Intel is now focused on solidifying footprint in the AI market through the integration of its Xeon processors with GPUs, field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) and the Nervana platform , which it acquired in Aug, 2016. Nervana is an expert in accelerating deep learning algorithms.Currently, Intel powers 97% of data center servers running AI workloads and its processor solutions of Xeon and Xeon Phi are most widely deployed processors for deep learning inference and training.The first integrated product – Lake Crest – is expected to be available by the end of 2017. Further, the company announced a new product – Knights Crest – in the pipeline.Intel now expects “ Nervana’s technologies to produce a breakthrough 100-fold increase in performance in the next three years to train complex neural networks, enabling data scientists to solve their biggest AI challenges faster. ” \nINTEL CORP Price \nAdditionally, Intel expects the next generation Xeon Phi processors to deliver up to four times better performance than the previous generation for deep learning. Code-named Knights Mill, the co-processor will be available in 2017. Acquisitions to Expand Footprint Apart from Nervana, the Movidius acquisition also expands Intel’s AI product portfolio. Movidius Myriad 2 vision processing unit (VPU) is a significant enhancement to Intel’s RealSense 3D cameras.Further, the acquisition of Altera Corp in Jun, 2015 helped Intel to gain access to FPGAs chips, which are used for deep-learning applications. FPGAs can be reprogrammed to desired application or functionality requirements after manufacturing.Moreover, Intel will offer the Saffron cognitive platform in its latest push to gain AI market share. The company acquired Saffron in Oct 2015. Per Intel “ Big data can happen on small devices, as long as they’re smart enough and connected. Saffron’s technology, deployed on small devices, can make intelligent local analytics possible in the Internet of Things .” Intel Collaborates with Google Further, Intel is collaborating with Google on software and other technology that will provide enterprises an open, flexible and secure multi-cloud infrastructure for their businesses. The partnership comprises technology integrations including Kubernates open source container management, machine learning, security and Internet of Things (IoT). Conclusion Intel’s focus on gaining footprint in the AI market is driven by the fact that its core personal computer business is slowing. However, Data Center and the IoT business hold significant growth promise. Moreover, Intel recently announced $250 million investment in autonomous driving technology. We believe that the aggressive investments are likely to boost the company’s chip sales, which will drive top-line growth going ahead. Zacks Rank & Key Pick Intel carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). NVIDIA is a better-ranked stock sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

      "text": "Trades from $ 3 \nTelefonaktiebolaget LM Ericsson ( ERIC - Free Report ) has been chosen by Panasonic Avionics Corporation, a leading supplier of inflight entertainment and communication systems, to provide 5G-ready core solutions. The technology will enable the next generation of connectivity services to the aviation industry and multiple other markets. \nPanasonic Avionics will implement Ericsson’s 5G-ready core solution through its subsidiary AeroMobile, a global inflight connectivity provider and registered mobile network operator. \nThe contract is the first step of a long-term strategic collaboration between the two companies, which will focus on areas like 5G and the Internet of Things. \nEricsson’s 5G-ready core leverages on NFV and SDN technologies, thus offering ultra-scalability, programmability and automation to the networks. It is powered with real-time instantiation of network functions and network slicing, which facilitates network resource optimization, new business models and rapid service innovation. \nPanasonic Avionics can apply the 5G-ready core across a wide and ever-expanding range of markets, enabling connectivity for users not only onboard aircraft and ships, but also for the huge Internet of Things communication. \nThe new platform will help Panasonic Avionics provide ubiquitous connectivity to its customers, thus boosting their operations with real time data across connected platforms. \nEricsson is already delivering its technology to industry-leading operators across the world for live commercial service. \nERICSSON LM ADR Price and Consensus \nERICSSON LM ADR Price and Consensus | ERICSSON LM ADR Quote \nTouted as the next generation of mobile technology, 5G has achieved rapid momentum over the past year. 5G networks have the capability to radically lessen latency, accelerate download and upload speeds, enhance network reliability and spectral efficiency. Also, they have the potential to support IoT development, by considerably escalating the number of devices that can connect to the network simultaneously. \nAccording to a research by Ovum, global 5G subscriptions are projected to reach 24 million by 2021, with Asia-Pacific having a 40% share and Europe accounting for 10%. \nEricsson continues to aggressively drive progress in 5G technology and is involved in multiple engagements with different operators across the world. It has already signed significant 5G agreements with telecom biggies, like Vodafone Group ( VOD - Free Report ) , Telefonica and Qualcomm Inc. ( QCOM - Free Report ) , to bank upon the commercialization of 5G technology. \nWe believe that strategic partnerships, dominant market share and favorable industry trends will aid the company to benefit significantly from the impending commercialization of the networks. \nHowever, Ericsson is contending with stiff competition from Huawei Technologies Co. and Nokia Corp. Slumping demand in Russia and Brazil, and accelerating negative industry trends have further compounded its problems. \nWhether the growth and cost-streamlining efforts of this Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) company will help it beat industry-wide demand blues, remains to be seen. \nStocks to Consider \nA better-ranked stock in the same space is Harris Corp. ( HRS - Free Report ) , carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here . \nHarris Corporation is an international company, focused on communications equipment for voice, data and video applications. The company has an impressive earnings surprise history for the trailing four quarters, beating estimates all through for an average of 4.2%. \nConfidential from Zacks \nBeyond this Analyst Blog, would you like to see Zacks' best recommendations that are not available to the public?

      "text": "NextEra Energy (NEE) Beats on Q3 Earnings, Reaffirms View \nFriday, November 18 2016 \nToday's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Amgen ( AMGN ), Cisco ( CSCO ) and NextEra Energy ( NEE ). \nBuy-rated Cisco has lost ground following the mixed quarterly report, but the stock is still up more than 10% in the year-to-date period and continues to lead the broader technology space. In the updated research report issued today, the Zacks analyst covering the stock highlights Cisco’s expanding footprint in the rapidly growing security and data center market. Moreover, partnerships with the likes of Pure Storage, salesforce.com and IBM will help Cisco to gain significant traction in the data center, cloud and Internet of Things (IoT) market in the long haul. (You can read the full research report on Cisco here>> ) \nAmgen shares have struggled this year, but it has come back following the election as fears of restrictive pricing and regulatory strictures have eased. The analyst points to Amgen’s impressive quarterly results, its portfolio of blockbuster drugs, the prospect for efficiency gains from the restructuring plan and track record of returning excess cash to shareholders through dividends and buybacks. Amgen is also progressing with its pipeline given quite a few regulatory and data updates scheduled for the coming quarters. However, the company has some challenges in store given the presence of biosimilar competition and slowdown in sales of mature products. (You can read the full research report on Amgen here>> ) \nNextEra Energy ’s shares have increased by more than 10% year-to-date but have struggled over the last quarter. NextEra Energy’s reported mixed third-quarter earnings. However, the analyst likes NextEra Energy's investment in renewable generation which should boost its performance over the long haul. Favorable economic conditions in its service territories will drive demand for utility services. Strategic acquisition and asset divestment bode well for NextEra Energy. On the flip side, NextEra Energy's nature of business is subject to complex and comprehensive federal, state and other regulations. Also, concerns related to commodity price fluctuations might deter its growth to some extent. (You can read the full research report on NextEra Energy here>> ) \nOther noteworthy reports we are featuring today include MasterCard (MA), AbbVie (ABBV) and eBay (EBAY). \nToday's Long-Term Buys & Sells Today you can gain access to the best long-term trades unearthed by Zacks Research.

      "text": "Apollo Gonzalez, CTO, CATAPULT SYSTEMS, LLC\nIn a recent report, IDC predicts that cloud computing will be a 107-billion-dollar industry by 2017. Gartner places Microsoft Azure in the leader’s quadrant for Infrastructure as a Service. With cloud computing showing no signs of slowing down and Microsoft firmly established as a leader in the space, it is important to examine what Microsoft Azure is and its impact, as well as where Microsoft is going in the next few years.\nMicrosoft Azure is a cloud platform that provides both low-level infrastructure and higher level cloud services that make it possible to run virtually any application in an elastic, scalable and redundant hosted environment. Low-level cloud services are those infrastructure building block services that developers or IT administrators use to host, store and run multi-tier applications. Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) is the primary low-level public cloud service that provides an instant computing infrastructure, provisioned and managed over the internet. The beauty of IaaS for most customers is decreased expense and complexity of managing physical servers and data center infrastructure. In fact, with IaaS it is possible to package up a line of business application, along with any supporting databases, and migrate to Microsoft Azure IaaS with very little friction.\nThere are many organizations that are not ready to place all of their eggs in the public cloud basket. So, Microsoft has created another low-level infrastructure private cloud service called Azure Stack that provides organizations with a hybrid cloud solution. Microsoft’s primary goal in creating a private cloud service is to give organizations the power of cloud services yet enabling them to maintain control of their datacenter for real hybrid cloud agility. If implemented correctly, organizations can run Azure Stack in their data center and, if they need more scalability, they can access the public cloud on demand.\n ​ The beauty of IaaS for most customers is decreased expense and complexity of managing physical servers and data center infrastructure\nWhile low-level infrastructure cloud services like IaaS and Azure Stack provide an easy migration path for customers who want to move existing workloads to the cloud, higher level services are Microsoft’s focus. In a recent interview, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella explained that, “Some of the most innovative work we’re seeing done is how people are going straight to micro-services and PaaS (Platform as a Service).It could be the samecustomer who was participating with us in the client-server era not just moving IT to the cloud but building new digital services. We’re seeing great growth in serverless architecture. It’s not just the Silicon Valley startups. It’s the core enterprises that are becoming digital companies.” When Nadella talks about serverless architecture, PaaS and microservices, he is indirectly referencing the higher level managed cloud services available in the Microsoft Azure cloud platform.\nHigher level services are those cloud services that provide abstraction from the management, architecting, and scaling requirements of core infrastructure.Some examples of higher level services include: SQL Data Warehouse, Machine Learning, Stream Analytics, Cognitive services and Internet of Things Suite (IoT). These services provide a user with all that is needed to create innovative cloud based solutions without having to purchase expensive hardware or software licenses. In a survey conducted by the Synergy Group, higher level services like database services, IoT, and PaaS have grown 100 percent or more per year.\nThe increased interest and usage of the higher level services is the next phase in the evolution of cloud computing. To more fully understand the impact and value these higher level Azure cloud services are having on organizations, let’s look at a fictitious business case study.\nA well-established organization wanted to innovate and differentiate their core business by making some of their hottest selling products smarter. The organization has been in the sporting goods business for a hundred years and made healthy margins on selling basketballs, footballs and tennis rackets. Over the past several years, not only did competition increase, but the company was competing on price and not quality or brand loyalty. The business realized that if they could make a smart basketball that could keep count of shots made and missed, they could charge 3 times more than their most expensive basketball. If successful, they could increase profit margins, differentiate themselves from the competition and apply the same strategy to their other products.\nThe sporting goods company realized quickly that they could not create smart products based on the technology they had available. They also realized that buying new hardware and software to support their big bet would significantly reduce their profit margins. The only real option was to look at the higher level cloud services from Microsoft Azure and determine if those services could do what they needed. The company settled on the Azure IoT suite to handle all of the sensor traffic from the basketball to Azure table storage. The company also used Azure App Services to create a mobile application that would allow anyone who purchased a smart basketball to login and see their statistics. The entire solution was created using higher level cloud service which significantly reduced their costs and allowed them to be more agile.\nCompanies will continue to support on-premises infrastructure and move existing workloads to low-level cloud services for several years to come. However, high-level cloud services are the future of cloud computing. They will reduce the barrier of entry for many companies and Microsoft will lead this effort by continuing to commoditize traditional platforms into higher level managed services.",

      "text": "Harman and IBM announce technology partnership \n19/11/2016 Harman and IT giant IBM have announced the two companies are to form a technology partnership to produce end-to-end, voice-controlled AVL (audio, video, lighting) solutions. In a statement by Mohit Parasher, president of Harman Professional said Recently, I was at the IBM World of Watson conference in Las Vegas, where I went on stage with Harriet Green, the leader of IBM's Internet of Things (IoT), for a keynote announcing a strategic partnership between Harman and IBM. In this partnership, we are looking to bring together Harman's end-to-end solutions with IBM Watson's cognitive computing capabilities.Together, Harman and IBM are looking to use audio, video, lighting, IoT and cognitive computing to improve the lives of workers, consumers and patients around the world. We are announcing this exciting partnership after the completion of a successful test of a prototype JBL speaker at Thomas Jefferson University Hospital in Philadelphia. This test showed that, with voice commands, a patient can control their environment, answer questions and alleviate an already overburdened healthcare staff.Of course, there are obvious and immediate applications for voice-enabled cognitive rooms by Harman in hotels, hospitals and conference rooms, but you can also imagine the possibilities in practically every enterprise and entertainment market we serve.Our solution is much more than a talking search engine. Its an expert: your concierge, your nurse, your executive assistant that anticipates what you need, answers your questions, knows what follow-up questions to ask, connects the dots for you between different sets of data and helps you control the environment around you. It makes life a little easier. LINK:  ",

      "text": "T he next BriefingsDirect Voice of the Customer digital transformation case study explores how linen services industry leader AmeriPride Services uses big data to gain a competitive and comprehensive overview of its operations, finances and culture.\nWe’ll explore how improved data analytics allows for disparate company divisions and organizations to come under a single umbrella -- to become more aligned -- and to act as a whole greater than the sum of the parts. This is truly the path to a digital business. Listen to the podcast . Find it on iTunes . Get the mobile app . Read a full transcript or download a copy.\nH ere to describe how digital transformation has been supported by innovations at the big data core, we’re joined by Steven John , CIO, and Tony Ordner , Information Team Manager, both at at AmeriPride Services in Minnetonka, Minnesota. The discussion is moderated by BriefingsDirect's Dana Gardner , Principal Analyst at Interarbor Solutions.\nHere are some excerpts:\nG ardner: Let’s discuss your path to being a more digitally transformed organization. What were the requirements that led you to become more data-driven, more comprehensive, and more inclusive in managing your large, complex organization? John\nJ ohn: One of the key business drivers for us was that we're a company in transition -- from a very diverse organization to a very centralized organization. Before, it wasn't necessarily important for us to speak the same data language, but now it's critical. We’re developing the lexicon, the Rosetta Stone , that we can all rely on and use to make sure that we're aligned and heading in the same direction.\nG ardner: And Tony, when we say “data,” are we talking about just databases and data within applications? Or are we being even more comprehensive -- across as many information types as we can?\nO rdner: It’s across all of the different information types. When we embarked on this journey, we discovered that data itself is great to have, but you also have to have processes that are defined in a similar fashion. You really have to drive business change in order to be able to effectively utilize that data, analyze where you're going, and then use that to drive the business. We're trying to institute into this organization an iterative process of learning.\nG ardner: For those who are not familiar with AmeriPride Services , tell us about the company. It’s been around for quite a while. What do you do, and how big of an umbrella organization are we talking about?\nLong-term investments\nJ ohn: The company is over 125 years old. It’s family-owned, which is nice, because we're not driven by the quarter. We can make longer-term investments through the family. We can have more of a future view and have ambition to drive change in different ways than a quarter-by-quarter corporation does.\nWe're in the laundry business. We're in the textiles and linen business. What that means is that for food and beverage, we handle tablecloths, napkins, chef coats, aprons, and those types of things. In oil and gas, we provide the safety garments that are required. We also provide the mats you cross as you walk in the door of various restaurants or retail stores. We're in healthcare facilities and meet the various needs of providing and cleansing the garments and linens coming out of those institutions. We're very diverse. We're the largest company of our kind in Canada, probably about fourth in the US, and growing. Become a Member of myVertica\nG ain Access t o the F ree\nHPE Vertica Community Edition\nG ardner: And this is a function that many companies don't view as core and they're very happy to outsource it. However, you need to remain competitive in a dynamic world. There's a lot of innovation going on. We've seen disruption in the taxicab industry and the hospitality industry. Many companies are saying, “We don’t want to be a deer in the headlights; we need to get out in front of this.”\nTony, how do you continue to get in front of this, not just at the data level, but also at the cultural level?\nO rdner: Part of what we're doing is defining those standards across the company. And we're coming up with new programs and new ways to get in front and to partner with the customers. Ordner\nAs part of our initiative, we're installing a lot of different technology pieces that we can use to be right there with the customers, to make changes with them as partners, and maybe better understand their business and the products that they aren't buying from us today that we can provide. We’re really trying to build that partnership with customers, provide them more ways to access our products, and devise other ways they might not have thought of for using our products and services.\nWith all of those data points, it allows us to do a much better job.\nG ardner: And we have heard from Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) the concept that it's the “analytics that are at the core of the organization,” that then drive innovation and drive better operations. Is that something you subscribe to, and is that part of your thinking?\nJ ohn: For me, you have to extend it a little bit further. In the past, our company was driven by the experience and judgment of the leadership. But what we discovered is that we really wanted to be more data-driven in our decision-making.\nData creates a context for conversation. In the context of their judgment and experience, our leaders can leverage that data to make better decisions. The data, in and of itself, doesn’t drive the decisions -- it's that experience and judgment of the leadership that's that final filter.\nWe often forget the human element at the end of that and think that everything is being driven by analytics, when analytics is a tool and will remain a tool that helps leaders lead great companies.\nG ardner: Steven, tell us about your background. You were at a startup, a very successful one, on the leading edge of how to do things different when it comes to apps, data, and cloud delivery.\nNew ways to innovate\nJ ohn: Yes, you're referring to Workday . I was actually Workday’s 33rd customer, the first to go global with their product. Then, I joined Workday in two roles: as their Strategic CIO, working very closely with the sales force, helping CIOs understand the cloud and how to manage software as a service (SaaS) ; and also as their VP of Mid-Market Services, where we were developing new ways to innovate, to implement in different ways and much more rapidly.\nAnd it was a great experience. I've done two things in my life, startups and turnarounds, and I thought that I was kind of stepping back and taking a relaxing job with AmeriPride. But in many ways, it's both; AmeriPride’s both a turnaround and a startup, and I'm really enjoying the experience.\nG ardner: Let’s hear about how you translate technology advancement into business advancement. And the reason I ask it in that fashion is that it seems as a bit of a chicken and the egg, that they need to be done in parallel -- strategy, ops, culture, as well as technology. How are you balancing that difficult equation?\nJ ohn: Let me give you an example. Again, it goes back to that idea of, if you just have the human element, they may not know what to ask, but when you add the analytics, then you suddenly create a set of questions that drive to a truth. Become a Member of myVertica\nG ain Access t o the F ree\nHPE Vertica Community Edition\nW e're a route-based business. We have over a 1,000 trucks out there delivering our products every day. When we started looking at margin we discovered that our greatest margin was from those customers that were within a mile of another customer.\nSo factoring that in changes how we sell, that changes how we don't sell, or how we might actually let some customers go -- and it helps drive up our margin. You have that piece of data, and suddenly we as leaders knew some different questions to ask and different ways to orchestrate programs to drive higher margin.\nG ardner: Another trend we've seen is that putting data and analytics, very powerful tools, in the hands of more people can have unintended, often very positive, consequences. A knowledge worker isn't just in a cube and in front of a computer screen. They're often in the trenches doing the real physical work, and so can have real process insights. Has that kicked in yet at AmeriPride, and are you democratizing analytics?\nO rdner: That’s a really great question. We've been trying to build a power-user base and bring some of these capabilities into the business segments to allow them to explore the data.\nYou always have to keep an eye on knowledge workers, because sometimes they can come to the wrong conclusions, as well as the right ones. So it's trying to make sure that we maintain that business layer, that final check. It's like, the data is telling me this, is that really where it is?\nI liken it to having a flashlight in a dark room. That’s what we are really doing with visualizing this data and allowing them to eliminate certain things, and that's how they can raise the questions, what's in this room? Well, let me look over here, let me look over there. That’s how I see that.\nToo much information\nJ ohn: One of the things I worry about is that if you give people too much information or unstructured information, then they really get caught up in the academics of the information -- and it doesn’t necessarily drive a business process or drive a business result. It can cause people to get lost in the weeds of all that data.\nYou still have to orchestrate it, you still have to manage it, and you have to guide it. But you have to let people go off and play and innovate using the data. We actually have a competition among our power-users where they go out and create something, and there are judges and prizes. So we do try to encourage the innovation, but we also want to hold the reins in just a little bit.\nG ardner: And that gets to the point of having a tight association between what goes on in the core and what goes on at the edge. Is that something that you're dabbling in as well?\nJ ohn: It gets back to that idea of a common lexicon. If you think about evolution, you don't want a Madagascar or a Tasmania, where groups get cut off and then they develop their own truth, or a different truth, or they interpret data in a different way -- where they create their own definition of revenue, or they create their own definition of customer.\nIf you think about it as orbits, you have to have a balance. Maybe you only need to touch certain people in the outer orbit once a month, but you have to touch them once a month to make sure they're connected. The thing about orbits and keeping people in the proper orbits is that if you don't, then one of two things happens, based on gravity. They either spin out of orbit or they come crashing in. The idea is to figure out what's the right balance for the right groups to keep them aligned with where we are going, what the data means, and how we're using it, and how often.\nG ardner: All right, let’s talk about lessons learned in infrastructure. Clearly, you've had an opportunity to look at a variety of different platforms, different requirements that you have had, that you have tested and required for your vendors. What is it about HPE Vertica , for example, that is appealing to you, and how does that factor into some of these digital transformation issues?\nO rdner: There are two things that come to mind right away for me. One is there were some performance implications. We were struggling with our old world and certain processes that ran 36 hours. We did a proof of concept with HPE and Vertica and that ran in something like 17 minutes. So, right there, we were sold on performance changes.\nAs we got into it and negotiated with them, the other big advantage we discovered is that the licensing model with the amount of data, versus the core model that everyone else runs in the CPU core. We're able to scale this and provide that service at a high speed, so we can maintain that performance without having to take penalties against licensing. Those are a couple of things I see. Anything from your end, Steven?\nJ ohn: No, I think that was just brilliant.\nG ardner: How about on that acquisition and integration of data. Is there an issue with that that you have been able to solve?\nO rdner: With acquisition and integration, we're still early in that process. We're still learning about how to put data into HPE Vertica in the most effective manner. So, we're really at our first source of data and we're looking forward to those additional pieces. We have a number of different telematics pieces that we want to include; wash aisle telematics as well as in-vehicle telematics. We're looking forward to that.\nThere's also scan data that I think will soon be on the horizon. All of our garments and our mats have chips in them. We scan them in and out, so we can see the activity and where they flow through the system. Those are some of our next targets to bring that data in and take a look at that and analyze it, but we're still a little bit early in that process as far as multiple sources. We're looking forward to some of the different ways that Vertica will allow us to connect to those data sources.\nG ardner: I suppose another important consideration when you are picking and choosing systems and platforms is that extensibility. RFID tags are important now; we're expecting even more sensors, more data coming from the edge, the information from the Internet of Things (IoT) . You need to feel that the systems you're putting in place now will scale out and up. Any thoughts about the IoT impact on what you're up to?\nOvercoming past sins\nJ ohn: We have had several conversations just this week with HPE and their teams, and they are coming out to visit with us on that exact topic. Being about a year into our journey, we've been doing two things. We've been forming the foundation with HPE Vertica and we've been getting our own house in order. So, there's a fair amount of cleanup and overcoming the sins of the past as we go through that process.\nBut Vertica is a platform; it's a platform where we have only tapped a small percentage of its capability. And in my personal opinion, even HPE is only aware of a portion of its capability. There are a whole set of things that it can do, and I don’t believe that we have discovered all of them. Become a Member of myVertica\nG ain Access t o the F ree\nHPE Vertica Community Edition\nW ith that said, we're going to do what you and Tony just described; we're going to use the telematics coming out of our trucks. We're going to track safety and seat belts. We're going to track green initiatives, routes, and the analytics around our routes and fuel consumption. We're going to make the place safer, we're going to make it more efficient, and we're going to get proactive about being able to tell when a machine is going to fail and when to bring in our vendor partners to get it fixed before it disrupts production.\nListen to the podcast .

This latest release reduces PCB development time by addressing the need to design reliable circuits for smaller, more compact devices.\nThis OrCAD portfolio includes technology enabled for integrated rigid-flex planning, design and real-time visualization, as well as built-in translators that enable direct design imports from select EDA vendors. PSpice Designer now supports system-level simulation using C/C++/SystemC and VerilogA, via the new PSpice compact model interface. This enables hardware/software virtual prototyping so that electrical engineers can design and simulate intelligent IoT devices. OrCAD is the only fully scalable PCB design solution available in the market that seamlessly transitions from mainstream to enterprise PCB solution with the Allegro environment. For more information on the latest OrCAD solution, visit: HERE\nTo enable a faster and more efficient flex and rigid-flex design creation critical to IoT, wearables and wireless devices, the OrCAD portfolio uses a new multi-stack-up database capability and extensive in-design inter-layer checks, which helps users avoid errors introduced through manual checking. The OrCAD portfolio also features enhancements targeted towards improving PCB editors' productivity and ease-of-use in padstack editing, constraint management, shape editing and in-design DRCs. To address efficiency needs, the portfolio includes an advanced design differencing engine that enables design review with global teams using state of art visuals. Finally, to give designers more control over their design component annotation process, advanced annotation and auto-referencing capabilities are now available.\nThe Cadence Allegro 17.2-2016 release enables a more predictable and shorter design cycle. The portfolio features comprehensive in-design inter-layer checking technology that minimizes design-check-redesign iterations and a new dynamic concurrent-team-design capability that accelerates product creation time by up to 50 percent. Utilizing material inlay fabrication techniques, these new capabilities can reduce material costs by up to 25 percent. In addition, embedded Sigrity technology now ensures critical signals meet performance criteria and power integrity (PI) for PCB designers addressing power delivery and IR drop issues efficiently, eliminating time-consuming iterations with PI experts.

      "text": "Home > The VAR Guy > What a President Trump Might Mean for the Internet of Things What a President Trump Might Mean for the Internet of Things Nov 18, 2016 Brian Buntz | The VAR Guy \nWhile Clinton promised to be friendlier to Silicon Valley, Trump promises to usher in a new era of infrastructure investment when he takes office. His proposal to restrict imports and H-1B visas, however, could be divisive. Related Media How Digital Technology Changed Presidential Politics Advertisement \nWhat will a Donald Trump presidency mean for the Internet of Things? Even attempting to answer that question is daunting, given the ambiguous-sounding policy proposals from his campaign during the election. The stock market, after initial jitters, has apparently warmed to the prospects of a Trump presidency. In the week following election day, the Dow has hit all-time highs, but the Mexican peso has plunged to record lows versus the dollar. The tech sector, too, had dropped 1.8% on November 15. After nearly uniformly opposing Trump during the presidential election, many in the tech industry are still in a state of shock. But Trump has also promised to make considerable investments in infrastructure and to boost the U.S. manufacturing sector. \nHere's what could be in store for the IoT sector under a Trump presidency: \nCybersecurity Become a Higher Priority for U.S. Government One of Trump’s first proposals as president is to order a review of all of the United States’ cyber defenses, including critical infrastructure. President-elect Trump also plans to mandate cybersecurity training for government employees and vows to create a joint task forces to coordinate government responses to cyber threats at the local, state, and federal levels. He has also promised to hire more cyber police, to boost the U.S. Cyber Command, and develop more advanced cyber weapons. “As a leader of our country, Donald Trump will need advisors to help him assess the seriousness of attacks as they present themselves,” says Michael Patterson, CEO of Plixer. “A good indicator of his commitment is his pledged to force mandatory cyber awareness training for all government employees. Education is a very smart first step in combating Internet evils. He is also for the creation of detailed protocols for staying current on new methods of cyber-attacks.” \nGrowing Concerns about IoT Data Privacy Nine months before Trump was elected, U.S. director of national intelligence James Clapper (who just announced his resignation) stated that the Internet of Things could open up new possibilities for surveillance by government spies. Based on his campaign rhetoric, Donald Trump appears to be generally in favor for expanding spying—both domestically and abroad. He has repeatedly stated that he tends to “err on the side of security” when explaining his support for the Patriot Act and other types of government surveillance. He has called Edward Snowden a “traitor” and supports NSA’s practice of gathering bulk metadata with court permission. In February of this year, Trump called for a boycott of Apple products owing to its feud with FBI. \nAlready, some European tech companies are using the prospects of a President Trump for marketing, boasting that European-based servers are tougher for spies to crack into. While President Obama has received pushback from the tech community for allowing NSA spying, it is likely that Trump would be more controversial in this regard. While the NSA employees could be more supportive, the current head of the agency and the U.S. Cyber Command, admiral Michael S. Rogers, alleges that Russia and Wikileaks conspired together to help get Trump elected. Still, Trump will probably be a big booster for the agency, and could potentially expand its powers using executive orders. \nCutting Back on Immigration \nThe H1-B visa program has been a target of controversy in recent years. Many employers based in Silicon Valley have called for the program to be expanded to help them find the talent they need. Critics, however, allege that many tech companies abuse the H1-B program, using it as an excuse to replace U.S. technology workers with cheaper labor. \nSilicon Valley companies are lobbying Trump with the claim that the H1-B program should be expanded to help them stay competitive in an international marketplace. \nThat may be an unlikely outcome, however, given Trump’s promises to prioritize jobs for U.S. citizens and to cut down on immigration. \nOn the campaign trail, Trump seemed to shift his opinion concerning the program. At one point, he said: “I know the H1-B very well. We shouldn’t have it; it’s very, very bad for workers.” Later, he argued for increasing the wage for H-1B visa recipients and making it a requirement for employers to look for U.S. workers before searching for foreign ones. During an exchange with Fox’s Megyn Kelly, Trump said that he had softened his position towards the program and that importing workers is sometimes a necessity. Following that, Trump said in a statement on his website: “I will end forever the use of the H-1B as a cheap labor program, and institute an absolute requirement to hire American workers first for every visa and immigration program. No exceptions.” \nConversely, Trump seems more sure of keeping Ivy League–trained immigrants in the country with the hopes that they will launch companies here. “I am all in favor of keeping these talented people here so they can go to work in Silicon Valley,” Trump told CNBC anchor Becky Quick. \nMeanwhile, Trump is reportedly looking to reward Senator and H1-B opponent Jeff Sessions (R-AL) with a cabinet post, according to the Washington Post. \nGiven his options, it would be simplest for Trump to modify the H-1B program to require employers to pay foreign workers more than the prevailing wage. Demanding that employers first research the labor market, however, would be more burdensome and would require public notice and comment before changing the rule. If Trump decides to scrap the H-1B program, Congress would need to amend the Immigration and Nationality Act. \nThe Cost of Electronics and Transportation Equipment Could Rise Trump has promised to erect hurdles to make it tougher for tech companies to send the production of electronics offshore. He has also threatened to slap tariffs in the range of 35 to 45% on some imports. \nIf he follows through with his plan, the cost of not only electronics but also transportation equipment and agricultural products could also go up significantly or the tariffs could eat into manufacturers’ margins, according to the U.S.-China Business Council. \nThe fortunes of U.S.-based electronics companies could brighten under Trump as they expand the scope of production to meet domestic demand. But while some companies that manufacture goods offshore could decide to relocate production to the U.S., the electronics supply chain in Asia is much more robust. In 2015, Chinese electronics exports were worth $600 billion while the U.S. share was worth $170 billion that same year. \nAnother factor that could lead to more expensive electronics include Trump’s promise to put tariffs on goods made in China while retooling NAFTA—both Mexico and Canada are among the top manufacturing countries. Much More Investment in Transportation and Other Types of Infrastructure \nOne of the things Trump likes most is building things. And the president-elect plans to spend $1 trillion on revamping infrastructure in the U.S. over the next decade, but the money won’t necessarily come from the government. He plans to sidestep the potential reservations of budget-conscious conservatives by using public-private partnerships to lead the projects. Trump is hoping that $140 billion in tax credits to spur the infrastructure overhaul. \nWithout question, this cash won’t simply be used to rebuild the infrastructure of yesteryear. Trump wants U.S. infrastructure to be \"second to none.\" Trump has also said: \"Americans deserve a reliable and efficient transportation network and the Trump Administration seeks to invest $550 billion to ensure we can export our goods and move our people faster and safer. We will harness technology and make smarter decisions on how we build and utilize our infrastructure.\" It will take more than $1 trillion in ten years, however, to even come close to equalling China’s investment in infrastructure. China spends more on infrastructure than the United States and Europe combined and has also been an aggressive investor in IoT-enabled smart infrastructure projects. In the first ten months of 2016 alone, the country spent $1.4 trillion on infrastructure.",

      "text": "Security Central: Fancy Bear Bites Again, the Internet of Things Moves Toward Security Advertisement \nIn the world of hackers these days, it seems to be all about making private - sometimes super-private - information public. Remember the Ashley Madison breach that occurred last year? For this week’s first story, think a bit bigger. It came to light on Monday that FriendFinder Networks, the parent company of AdultFriendFinder, Cams, Penthouse, iCams.com and Stripshow, had been breached. As a result, according to breach notification website Leaked Source , over 412 million accounts were leaked. For context and comparison, the Ashley Madison breach affected 32 million users. It even tops the MySpace breach of 2013, which affected 360 million accounts. \nAccording to Leaked Source, the hack actually occurred back in October, and the accounts that were hacked represent 20 years of customer's data. Not a great time to belong to a site or network that bills itself as the “World’s largest sex & swinger community.” According to TechCrunch , FriendFinder’s network was apparently hacked through a local file inclusion exploit, which allowed the hackers to break in and gain access all of the network’s sites. \nRelated: \nSecurity Central: Webcams Recalled in Cyber-attack Aftermath, NIST Announces CyberSeek Tool \nIt’s worth noting that this is not the first time that FriendFinder Networks has been breached. It also happened in May of 2015 when 3.5 million accounts were hacked. Let’s do the math on that one - that’s two times in two years. Ouch. Clearly, some rather important t’s and i’s have been left un-crossed and un-dotted, so let’s take a look at what FriendFinder has been doing wrong here. It all essentially comes down to very poor security practices. The first example of such oversights has to do with passwords. The company stored user passwords either in plain visible format, without any protection, or using the notoriously weak SHA1 algorithm. According to Leaked Source, “neither method is considered secure by any stretch of the imagination.” FriendFinder also retained email and passwords for over 15 million people who had deleted their accounts. \nStu Sjouwerman, CEO of KnowBe4, a integrated security awareness training and simulated phishing platform, has voiced some concerns regarding the partner/business side of things. Specifically, he is worried that phishing attacks and bogus websites threatening to expose Adult Friend Finder clients are going to pop up and that clients will panic and click on the links to avoid being caught. He recommends partners and business leaders communicate the threat to their customers (and employees) and consider employee awareness training to prevent exposing their networks. \n“AdultFriendFinder has failed to learn from their mistakes and now 412 million people are high-value targets for blackmail, phishing attacks and other cybercrime,” says Sjouwerman. “This is a wakeup call for vendors to ensure their customers and users are protected. Any MSP or service provider should consider this a threat due to multiple-use passwords by their customer's users and possible exploits that we predict will happen. Allowing for new-school security awareness training is an absolute must these days.” \nLeaked Source says it will not make the data set searchable by the general public. For now. In the meantime, FriendFinder appears to be trying to get to the bottom of things and take the necessary steps to become secure. \"We are aware of the data hack and we are waiting on FriendFinder to give us a detailed account of the scope of the breach and their remedial actions in regard to our data,\" said Kelly Holland, the site's chief executive, in an email on Saturday. \nIn other news, Google is reportedly cracking down on sites that repeatedly violate their safe browsing policies. According to TechNewsWorld , the company stated last week that offending sites will be classified as repeat offenders from here on out. What typically happens is that websites will take corrective actions after Google displays alerts on their landing pages warning visitors that they're harmful. However, they “typically revert to violating the policies after Google goes through the process of verifying that they're safe and removes the warnings.” Well, no more. \nAccording to TechNewsWorld, about 1 billion people use Google Safe Browsing and millions of people are protected by warnings on malicious websites, according to Google's transparency report . While the intentions there are good and it does work for some, it’s still not enough. Malicious spam has skyrocketed. To give you an idea, 61 percent of email Web traffic in September contained spam, the majority of which contained ransomware, malware or links to malicious sites, according to Kaspersky Lab . \n\"While 30 days may not be strict enough, the behavior [Google is] trying to prevent is malicious intent within the site,\" Thomas Pore, director of IT and services at Plixer International, told TechNewsWorld. Google's strategy \"may cause the malicious actor to move on, but the drawback here is that the [actor] may move on and set up another domain, and there will be new victims.\" \nAdam Meyer, chief security strategist at SurfWatch Labs, stressed that it’s important to remember that cybercrime is a business, and \"the more costly we make [it] for the criminal, the better off we will be.” Google’s new internet hall monitors will no doubt have a positive impact and may do a lot of much-needed site housecleaning. However, it is being met with some skepticism among experts. The crackdown \"should help shut down sites that are harmful, but it may make people feel safer than they actually are, and it looks like it's more focused on good PR for Google,\" said Rob Enderle, principal analyst at the Enderle Group. \nIf you're a partner serving as your customers' outsourced IT department, take note. With Google’s new procedures, verification procedures may launch automatically, or webmasters can request verification through Google's Search Console. Webmasters of sites that have been flagged as “repeat offenders” will have to wait for 30 days before being able to request additional reviews through the Search Console under the new rules, which went into effect last week. Web administrators \"will need to be more vigilant on correcting vulnerabilities on their websites, and stop sweeping issues under the carpet,\" stressed Adam Meyer. \nTo wrap up the week, a few tidbits on automated and centralized systems. Issues with these systems have peppered tech news off and on over the years, but have increased recently as they becoming more and more prevalent. These types of systems have brought about greater efficiency for businesses over the years. More and more of the tools and devices organizations use on a daily basis are now connected to the internet, allowing business practices to be streamlined and simplified. However, as more devices become part of the Internet of Things (IoT), they make an organization more susceptible to a major hack or cyber-attack – sometimes costing thousands of dollars. \n“It’s true that automation has brought about greater speed, efficiency and lowered the cost of these services, but with these advantages comes greater risk,” says Idan Udi Edry, CEO at Nation-E, a global leader in cyber protection for critical infrastructure and the industrial internet of things (IIoT). “The problem is that when these systems were conceived, cyber-attacks were not as prevalent, so they were not designed with internal security measures. But as we become more and more dependent on these networks to control our critical infrastructure, our vulnerabilities become vividly apparent.” \nIt’s a scary thought. Indeed, considering the amount of control we give to networks and how much we rely on them, if a cyber-attacker were to successfully hack into a system, they would have complete control and the power to do severe damage. In order to keep the progress we’ve made, yet secure our utilities from cyber-attacks, providers need to get on the comprehensive cybersecurity train. \n“Cybersecurity methods must stay ahead of the hackers, and we must constantly evolve our practices and strategies to identify different attack methods before they happen,” says Edry. “Having a safe and secure network for our critical infrastructure is paramount to our success as a society.”",

      "text": "tweet People are, on average, terrible drivers. How do you solve this problem? Do not let them drive or put a machine in its place? Self-driving vehicles are not some futuristic automotive technology that we are yet to see. These are cars from the likes of BMW and Tesla with self-driving features on the road. There are two types that are being tested or that are on the road: semi-autonomous cars that we already see and fully autonomous ones that are expected anywhere between two to 14 years depending on whom you ask. Tesla CEO Elon Musk and Google’s Sergey Brin are two people who believe that it will be sooner rather than later. Chris Urmson, who heads Google’s driverless car programme, said in a talk, “My oldest son is 11, and that means in four and a half years he will be eligible to get a driver’s licence. My team and I are committed to make sure that does not happen.” So when these arrive, what would enable cars to safely roam our streets by themselves? Sense of sight In order for your car to be aware of its surroundings, it first needs to see where it is standing. LiDAR . LiDAR, or Light Detection And Ranging, is one of the most popular and actively-used technologies that enable self-driving cars to see. The most recognised version of LiDAR is the one you see on top of Google’s self-driving cars, and it is HDL-64E. Velodyne’s HDL-64E enables obstacle detection and navigation with a 360° field-of-view. Enabled by 64 laser beams, this is probably one of the best and most expensive solutions available right now. LoRaWAN: One Small Step in Data Transmission, A Giant Leap for IoT Another firm, Quanergy, recently announced a solid-state LiDAR named S3 that has no moving parts or micro-mirrors. Instead, it uses an optical-phased array as a transmitter, which can steer pulses of light by shifting the phase of a laser pulse as it is projected through the array. S3 is due to be available in September. The major benefit of using LiDAR systems is that the data these generate is easier to compute and process as compared to the data generated from a camera. These can also work in places where GPS and mapping data are not really accurate. Volvo Group has an autonomous FMX heavy-duty vehicle designed to work in underground mines without the need for a driver. Of all the demonstrations that we at EFY have come across of LiDAR usage, perhaps the best is when the car picks up a cyclist waiting to cross the road on the other side of a pickup truck. Drivers in the car are not able to see the cyclist, but LiDAR laser picks it up, calculates the distance and prevents the car from moving ahead until the cyclist has passed. Cameras . Mercedes F015, about which we wrote last year, does not use LiDAR, but a mix of 3D stereoscopic cameras, radars and ultrasonic sensors for its autonomous functions. It is very much possible to set up driver-assistance systems using just camera data, like how Land Rover Discovery Sport does with a Bosch stereo video camera. Its spatial measurements and video signals provide enough data to calculate, for example, the distance to vehicles ahead. The Power Of Grid Computing This is nothing new, of course, as Subaru has been marketing their own version since 2010, and Continental has their own forward-looking braking system with stereoscopic cameras that is just as old. Infrared or thermal imaging cameras have been available that can detect hidden objects like people or animals in total darkness, smoke or fog-like conditions when normal detection systems may not easily pick these up. FLIR Systems PathFindIR is a compact thermal imaging camera that significantly reduces the hazards of night time driving, and is designed for both military vehicles as well as commercial vehicles as an aftermarket part. These systems have improved from mere night vision to being able to identify a hazardous object or even go as far as alerting the object. Mercedes had CL550 a few years back that would identify pedestrians on the road and flash them with four blasts of diverted headlight while highlighting them with white brackets on users’ screens. While LiDAR and cameras are great for generating an accurate map of the car’s surroundings, these are not ideal for monitoring the speed of other moving objects in real-time. So what do we do? 1 ",

Top executives would occasionally appear in front of Congress to inveigh mostly against one another, then quickly return home to resume making money. The notion that clueless DC regulators and legislators mattered was ridiculed when it wasn’t ignored.

In fact, interoperability is not a new trend. It has been an important mission (and a challenge) for healthcare administrators for decades, but the past couple of years have been game-changing. First, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) wants interoperability to be a common feature in all EHRs by 2024 so that patient data can be shared across systems to provide better care at a lower cost. Since the 2009 passage of the Health Information Technolog...

Often this means massive amounts of learning can be accomplished every second without stop 24x7x365. Code doesn't need to take weekends off, holidays, or sick time. Code doesn't get tired. It can recognize complex patterns, areas of potential improvement and problems in real-time (aka digital-time).

How? Machines are now “internet-connected” just like the smartphones we carry around in our pockets. And this isn’t just on the commercial side with the likes of smart thermostats or connected vehicles – even tractors and oil and gas machinery are industrial examples of where new “things” are now on the digital network. ...

That's because there will be an increasing need for authentication, for access control, for security, for application delivery as the number of potential endpoints (clients, devices, things) increases. That means scale in the data center. What we gloss over, what we skip, is that before any of these \"things\" ever makes a request to access an application it had to execute a DNS query. Every.

One challenge that faces every WebRTC deployment (in some form or another) is identity management. For example, if you have an existing service – possibly built on a variety of different PaaS/SaaS offerings – and you want to add real-time communications you are faced with a challenge relating to user management, authentication, authorization, and validation. Service providers will want to use their existing identities, but these will have credentials already that are (hopefully) i...

Because each container typically runs a single process, has its own environment, utilizes virtual networks, or has various methods of managing storage. Traditional monitoring solutions take metrics from each server and applications they run. These servers and applications running on them are typically very static, with very long uptimes. Docker deployments are different: a set of containers may run many applications, all sharing the resources of one or more underlying hosts. It's not uncommon for Docker servers to run thousands of short-te...

Camera fades in to Pastor Schmarzo heading to the pulpit… What does the future hold for today’s big data vendors? Hundreds of startups are rushing into the big data market to stake their claim to a market that IDC predicts will reach $187 billion by 2019. Dang, that’s a big market, especially considering that the Global Business Intelligence market will only reach a trifling $20.8 billion by 2018 or the long-running ERP applications market is expected to reach a trivial $84.1 billion by 2020. Yes, the big data market opportu... Nov. 2, 2016 09:45 PM EDT Reads: 3,497 The 'Internet of Things' Is the New Big Data? By Jim Kaskade My favorite writer, Gil Press, sums it up with, “It’s Official: The Internet Of Things Takes Over Big Data As The Most Hyped Technology” where he talks about how Gartner released its latest Hype Cycle for Emerging Technologies, and how big data has moved down the “trough of disillusionment,” replaced by the Internet of Things at the top of the hype cycle. The term Internet of Things was coined by the British technologist Kevin Ashton in 1999, to describe a system where the Internet is connected to the physical world via ubiquitous sensors.

Onalytica analyzed the online debate on M2M by looking at over 85,000 tweets to provide the most influential individuals and brands that drive the discussion. According to Onalytica the \"analysis showed a very engaged community with a lot of interactive tweets. The M2M discussion seems to be more fragmented and driven by some of the major brands present in the M2M space. This really allows some room for influential individuals to create more high value inter...

Onalytica analyzed Twitter conversations around the #IoT debate to uncover the most influential brands and individuals driving the conversation. Onalytica captured data from 56,224 users. The PageRank based methodology they use to extract influencers on a particular topic (tweets mentioning #InternetofThings or #IoT in this case) takes into account the number and quality of contextual references that a user receives.

Much of that potential comes from the evolving data management and analytic (DMA) technologies and processes that allow us to gain insight from all of the IoT data that can be generated and gathered. This potential may never be met as those data sets are tied to specific industry verticals and single markets, with no clear way to use IoT data and sensor analytics to fulfill the hype being given the IoT today.

Black Mirror is a Sci-Fi anthology series, ala the Twilight Zone, although with a much darker perspective on both humanity and technology. I found the episode, ‘Most Hated in the Nation’ somewhat apropos to my topic. The episode follows a police detective investigating the apparent murder of a columnist. This individual has been deluged with social media hate diatribes that would seem familiar to many. As the investigation continues, more mysterious deaths occur, with the victim...

The native level support will offer a massive performance boost to frameworks having to fake all these features like Polymer and Angular. It will also encourage people who are not familiar with th...

      "title": "Metering Trends for 2017 Focus on Cellular Technology, Managed Solutions, Software as a Service and the Importance of Accurate and Reliable Meters",
      "text": "Badger Meter, a leading global innovator and manufacturer of flow measurement, control and communications solutions, today shared four key trends predicted to shape the water utility industry in 2017.\nMilwaukee, Wis. (PRWEB) November 17, 2016\nBadger Meter , a leading global innovator and manufacturer of flow measurement, control and communications solutions, today shared four key trends predicted to shape the water utility industry in 2017. The trends are based on the company’s experience in working with thousands of water utilities across the United States in helping them to select the right metering system for their needs and creating more efficient and sustainable water infrastructures.\n“In 2016, we saw advancements in cellular technology, data analytics and managed solutions that can help utility managers more effectively and efficiently understand, monitor and manage their operations. We expect these trends to become even more significant for water utilities in 2017,” said John Fillinger, director of utility marketing at Badger Meter. “We also predict an increased focus on the water meter itself, because the key to optimizing a software analytics platform is obtaining the most accurate and reliable usage data possible.”\nFour key water themes predicted to shape 2017 are:\nGrowth in Cellular Communications - Compared to traditional Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) systems, cellular-based communications offer substantially greater ease in deployment and scalability. Cellular endpoints rely on existing cellular networks, thereby eliminating the need for traditional network infrastructure, such as gateways. Because of their flexibility, cellular endpoints can be deployed rapidly, from targeted implementations for large commercial customers and hard-to-read locations to full-scale rollouts. Badger Meter was the first major meter manufacturer to introduce cellular endpoints to the market. Since launching its ORION® Cellular endpoint in 2014 as part of its BEACON® Advanced Metering Analytics (AMA) managed solution, the demand for this innovative technology has far exceeded expectations. The company is at the forefront of future advancements in cellular networks as a major participant supporting the water utility industry in a pilot for AT&T’s first LTE-M commercial site designed to support a variety of IoT solutions, including smart meters.\nInterest in Managed Solutions - Along with the increase in cellular technology is an evolution to a managed systems approach to data management. Traditionally, utilities implemented and managed their own networks, which for many provided operational challenges in the areas of communications infrastructure management and the IT resources needed for software and hardware support. In the provider-managed cloud-based systems approach, the provider installs and maintains the operation of the network, leaving the utility responsible only for the meters and endpoints. The software applications are hosted by the solutions provider, enabling utility staff to do what it does best – manage the utility’s operations. The Badger Meter BEACON AMA managed solution is hosted off-site on the largest global cloud hosting service, leaving critical metering data less susceptible to natural disasters. All that is needed to access the software is a personal computer and browser. Committed to data protection and customer security, in 2015 Badger Meter obtained certification of its Information Security Management System (ISMS) under ISO 27001 and met the Service Organization Control (SOC) reporting framework of SOC 2.\nAcceptance of Software as a Service (SaaS) - The transition to software as a service is a trend that is impacting virtually every industry, including municipal water. Many utilities are finding cloud-computing to be a viable alternative to investing money and staff time in maintaining and updating their own servers and operating software. Cloud-based platforms use open-source software that is not reliant on any one vendor. They are subscription based, with utilities paying only for the number of endpoints deployed. Cloud-based software is quick to deploy, does not require any hardware purchases, includes automatic software updates and can be scaled up or down as needed. Utilities using the BEACON AMA solution can also engage their customers in water conservation through the EyeOnWater® mobile app that enables consumers to see and understand their water use on their smartphone or laptop.\nRecognizing the Importance of the Meter - Today’s software is only as good as the data it relies on, and that’s where the quality of the water meter comes in. While some may consider water meters to be a commodity, investing in highly accurate, long-lasting meters adds value to the total metering system, driving revenues and helping to ensure the reliability the decision-making information provided by the metering software. The nutating disc technology used in all Badger Meter Recordall® positive displacement disc meters consistently indicated higher accuracies at the lowest flow rates compared to other meter types in a 2010 study by the Water Research Foundation. As confirmed by the study, the nutating disc technology incorporated in Recordall positive displacement meters provides a solution that can drive additional revenue and provide the lowest cost of ownership. In addition, Badger Meter offers more metering technologies than any other major meter manufacturer, including its line of E-Series® Ultrasonic meters that use solid-state, high-frequency sound waves to measure flows.\nBy selecting the right meter for each application and a cloud-based managed-services software platform with cellular technology, water utilities can efficiently operate their water delivery system and provide accurate, responsive, customer service.\nAbout Badger Meter\nBadger Meter is an innovator in flow measurement, control and communications solutions, serving water utilities, municipalities, and commercial and industrial customers worldwide. The company’s products measure water, oil, chemicals, and other fluids, and are known for accuracy, long-lasting durability and for providing valuable and timely measurement data.

      "text": "IoT Infrastructure Investments to be Covered By First-of-a-Kind Industrial Insurance\nRelayr, HSB Team Up to Insure that IoT Returns Match a Company’s Projections.\nCompanies making substantial investments in the “Internet of Things” (IoT) will be able to protect their return on those investments through an innovative new breed of “IoT-enabled” insurance products, relayr, the industry leader in IoT platforms, said today.\nRelayr announced it is partnering with HSB, part of Munich Re, to craft customized insurance products to provide financial confidence for relayr’s customers making IoT investments. HSB has 150 years of experience insuring the equipment and technology used by businesses; its work with relayr represents the insurance industry’s first industrial IoT-specific set of offerings.\nRelayr co-founder Josef Brunner said the collaboration with HSB will transform the entire IoT landscape.\n“People have long talked about the potential savings and increased efficiencies that are going to be possible with the Internet of Things,” Brunner said. “But now, we are doing much more than talking about it. We are literally going to do it.”\nBrunner said HSB decided to partner with relayr after becoming a customer and seeing for itself the advantages of the company’s IoT hardware, software and consulting services.\nIn addition to joining forces on the innovative new line of insurance products, Munich Re/HSB Ventures is also leading a $23 million financing round for relayr, in which it is being joined by legendary Silicon Valley venture firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, as well as Munich Venture Partners.\nGreg Barats, president and chief executive officer of HSB, said the relayr partnership is only possible because of the IoT itself, notably the way it provides non-stop, real-time information that HSB can use to inform its underwriting decisions.\n“We’re excited about collaborating with relayr to combine insurance solutions with their IoT applications,” Barats said.\n“HSB can help relayr’s clients have confidence in their IoT investments by creating financial assurance that they will benefit, whether it involves increasing output, decreasing downtime, developing new revenue streams or reducing maintenance costs.”\nBrunner said the partnership with HSB will not only benefit the companies that work with relayr directly, but also has the potential to, in turn, help the customers of those companies. For example, one of relayr’s first industrial customers in IoT is Schindler, a leading global elevator and escalator provider.\n“As a customer of relayr from the early days, I am very pleased with their strategic eco-system development,” said Michael Nilles, Schindler Chief Digital Officer. “The new partnerships will allow relayr to further expand their business scope from technology towards comprehensive IoT based business model offerings for the benefit of existing and new customers.”",

      "text": "Tata group joins hands with global leaders to set up an IoT technology incubator in Israel\nMumbai: The Tata group has joined hands with General Electric Ventures, Microsoft Ventures, Qualcomm Ventures, HNA EcoTech, Pitango Venture Capital and RAMOT, the Business Engagement Center of Tel Aviv University (TAU), to establish a new technology incubator in Israel. With the first closing of $20 million, the incubator called i3 Equity Partners (i3) will focus on developing next-generation IoT (Internet of Things) and IIoT (Industrial Internet of Things) technologies.\nThrough this collaboration, the Tata group along with the other partners will support promising early-stage Israeli ventures, enabling them to reach an advanced phase of development, and ultimately strengthen their presence in global markets. The partners, on their part, expect to tap the acclaimed ingenuity and knowhow of the Israeli tech industry, for growing their enterprises in the field of IoT, which is expected to transform how industry operates and how individuals live, work and play.\nWith headquarters at the TAU campus, i3 will be headed by managing partners Noga Kap and Eran Wagner, both successful Israeli entrepreneurs as well as investors with extensive experience in early-stage investments, and chaired by Shlomo Nimrodi, chief executive officer of RAMOT, and a veteran of the Israeli high-tech industry.\nCommenting on this partnership, KRS Jamwal, executive director, Tata Industries, said, “The Tata group is excited about partnering with leading multinationals like GE, Qualcomm and Microsoft, along with Tel Aviv University and the venture capital fund Pintago. The group, since inception, has focused on developing new technologies in the spirit of innovation that is strongly embedded in its DNA. We hope to provide guidance and mentorship to the start-ups based on our experience of operating across a range of sectors, across multiple geographies. We could also potentially help start-ups scale easily by facilitating better access to market. This collaboration will help us identify and support breakthrough innovations in IoT, and look forward to having early access to new technologies with a focus on high quality products and ideas that will develop through this initiative.”\nShlomo Nimrodi, chairman, i3 Equity Partners, said, \"This one-of-a-kind collaboration of some of the world's largest corporations with Israel's leading academic institution and largest venture capital fund, is a testament to their trust in the ability of Israeli entrepreneurs to come up with the next big thing that will transform our world. The fact that we were able to bring all these leading partners around one table, providing access to their technologies, markets and clients, and also attract top venture capital talent to lead this initiative, generates the highly unique differentiators we will be offering to top entrepreneurs.\"\ni3 will annually provide 3-5 high-potential seed and pre-seed start-ups with optimal conditions for success including the following:\nFinancial investment of up to $1 million each, supplemented by high-value in-kind contributions including but not limited to technology, tools, mentoring, business development and other services;\nAccess to supportive multinational corporations at all stages of development: technology validation, design, proof-of-concept, later-stage investments, and ultimately the purchase of mature technologies and their distribution in high-potential markets – including China and India;\nAn inspiring centre of excellence offering world-class office space right next to the TAU campus with its multiple research and service centres;\nActive professional assistance in the crucial processes of business development, marketing, recruiting and product innovation.\nIoT brings together the various IT technologies developed over the past decades – big data and analytics, machine learning, cyber security, sensors and communications networks – to create connected solutions that are already starting to change every aspect of our lives: from health through transportation and home appliances to aviation, agriculture, industrial manufacturing and much more.",

      "text": "Samsung Electronics to Acquire HARMAN, Accelerating Growth in Automotive and Connected Technologies\nNovember 14, 2016 Corporate\nSamsung Will Gain Significant Presence in Connected Car Market; Addressable Market Expected to Exceed $100 Billion by 2025\nAll-Cash Transaction Delivers Significant and Immediate Value to HARMAN Shareholders\nCreates End-to-End Solutions Powerhouse by Combining HARMAN’s Leadership in Infotainment, Telematics and Sound Management with Samsung’s Best-in-Class Connected Mobility Solutions, Semiconductors, User Experience (UX) and Displays\nAccelerates Development and Time to Market for Connected Car and Autonomous Driving Innovation\nSubstantial Growth Opportunities Across Automotive, Audio, IoT and Professional Markets\nSEOUL, Korea and STAMFORD, CT – Samsung Electronics (KRX: 005930) (“Samsung”) and Harman International Industries, Incorporated (NYSE: HAR) (“HARMAN”) today announced that they have entered into a definitive agreement under which Samsung will acquire HARMAN for $112.00 per share in cash, or total equity value of approximately $8.0 billion. Upon closing, the transaction will immediately give Samsung a significant presence in the large and rapidly growing market for connected technologies, particularly automotive electronics, which has been a strategic priority for Samsung, and is expected to grow to more than $100 billion by 2025[1]. HARMAN is the market leader in connected car solutions, with more than 30 million vehicles currently equipped with its connected car and audio systems, including embedded infotainment, telematics, connected safety and security. Approximately 65% of HARMAN’s $7.0 billion of reported sales during the 12 months ended September 30, 2016 are automotive-related, and its order backlog for this market at June 30, 2016 was approximately $24 billion.\nHARMAN’s experience designing and integrating sophisticated in-vehicle technologies, as well as its long-term relationships with most of the world’s largest automakers, will create significant growth opportunities for the combined business by enabling it to leverage Samsung’s expertise in connected mobility, semiconductors, user experience, displays and its global distribution channels. In addition, the combination of HARMAN’s brands and audio capabilities and Samsung’s expertise in consumer electronics will deliver enhanced customer benefits and elevate user experiences across Samsung’s complete portfolio of consumer and professional products and systems.\n“HARMAN perfectly complements Samsung in terms of technologies, products and solutions, and joining forces is a natural extension of the automotive strategy we have been pursuing for some time,” said Oh-Hyun Kwon, Vice Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Samsung Electronics. “As a Tier 1 automotive supplier with deep customer relationships, strong brands, leading technology and a recognized portfolio of best-in-class products, HARMAN immediately establishes a strong foundation for Samsung to grow our automotive platform. Dinesh Paliwal is a proven global leader and, in our extensive discussions, we have developed deep respect for him, his strong senior leadership team and HARMAN’s talented employees. HARMAN’s sustained track record of rapid growth fueled by technology leadership and an unmatched automotive order pipeline reflects its commitment to innovation and customers.”\n“The vehicle of tomorrow will be transformed by smart technology and connectivity in the same way that simple feature phones have become sophisticated smart devices over the past decade,” added Young Sohn, President and Chief Strategy Officer of Samsung Electronics. “We see substantial long-term growth opportunities in the auto technology market as demand for Samsung’s specialized electronic components and solutions continues to grow. Working together, we are confident that HARMAN can become a new kind of Tier 1 provider to the OEMs by delivering end-to-end solutions across the connected ecosystem.”\nDinesh Paliwal, HARMAN Chairman, President and CEO, stated, “This compelling all-cash transaction will deliver significant and immediate value to our shareholders and provide new opportunities for our employees as part of a larger, more diversified company. Today’s announcement is a testament to what we have achieved and the value that we have created for shareholders. Samsung is an ideal partner for HARMAN and this transaction will provide tremendous benefits to our automotive customers and consumers around the world. Combining Samsung’s strengths in leading-edge displays, connectivity and processing solutions with HARMAN’s technology leadership and long-standing customer relationships will enable OEMs to provide new offerings for their customers. Partnerships and scale are essential to winning over the long term in automotive as demand for robust connected car and autonomous driving solutions increases at a rapid pace. This transaction will bring HARMAN and Samsung’s complementary strengths together to accelerate innovation in this space. More broadly, this investment underscores the strength of HARMAN’s employees, as well as our success and leadership across our markets. We look forward to working together with Samsung to elevate experiences for consumers worldwide.”\nCustomer Benefits and Significant Growth Opportunities\nSamsung expects the combination to deliver significant growth opportunities and benefits to customers by leveraging Samsung’s and HARMAN’s complementary technologies, resulting in increased market penetration across important end markets.\nAutomotive: Combining HARMAN’s leadership in new connected car technologies, including its top positions in infotainment, cyber security, over-the-air updates and telematics, with Samsung’s significant expertise and experience in connectivity technologies, including 5G, UX/UI, display technology and security solutions, will enhance HARMAN’s automotive and connected services businesses to drive greater sales and provide significant benefits as automakers speed the adoption of next-generation connected cars.\nAudio: HARMAN’s leading brands and cutting-edge audio systems include JBL®, Harman Kardon®, Mark Levinson®, AKG®, Lexicon®, Infinity®, and Revel®. The company also licenses Bowers & Wilkins® and Bang & Olufsen® brands for automotive. All of these brands will greatly enhance the competitiveness of Samsung’s mobile, display, virtual reality and wearable products to deliver a fully differentiated audio and visual experience for customers.\nProfessional: The combination will also expand the combined company’s business-to-business platform through its ability to deliver integrated, large-scale audio and visual professional solutions at stadiums, concert facilities and other performance centers such as The John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts and STAPLES Center – home of the GRAMMY Awards®.\nConnected Services: Samsung will gain access to HARMAN’s 8,000 software designers and engineers who are unlocking the potential of the IoT market. This collaboration will deliver the next generation of cloud-based consumer and enterprise experiences, as well as end-to-end services for the automotive market through the convergence of design, data and devices.\nOperating Structure and Leadership\nUpon closing, HARMAN will operate as a standalone Samsung subsidiary, and continue to be led by Dinesh Paliwal and HARMAN’s current management team. Samsung is pursuing a long-term growth strategy in automotive electronics, and plans to retain HARMAN’s work force, headquarters and facilities, as well as all of its consumer and professional audio brands. Samsung believes the combination will increase career development and advancement opportunities for the employees of both companies.\nSamsung’s Automotive Electronics Business Team, which was established in December of 2015 to identify opportunities for Samsung in the automotive sector, will work closely with the HARMAN management team to realize the full growth potential of the combination.\nTerms of the Transaction\nThe purchase price represents a premium of 28% based on HARMAN’s closing stock price on November 11, 2016 and a 37% premium to HARMAN’s 30-calendar day volume weighted average price ending November 11, 2016. Samsung expects to use cash on hand to fund the transaction. The agreement has been unanimously approved by the boards of directors of both companies.\nThe transaction, which is subject to approval by HARMAN shareholders, regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions, is expected to close in mid-2017.\nAdvisors\nEvercore is serving as financial advisor to Samsung and Paul Hastings LLP is acting as legal counsel. J.P. Morgan and Lazard are serving as financial advisors to HARMAN and Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz is acting as legal counsel.",

      "text": "Home CATALAN ECONOMY A Catalonia Trade & Investment study reveals there are 270 Catalan companies in the smart city sector, employing 116,000 people 15.11.2016 \n• According to the report, the collective company turnover linked to activity connected to smart cities comes to 6,969 million euros, 3% of the Catalan GDP. \n• The study points out that 82% of Catalan companies in this sector are SMEs, 51% export and that they are mainly specialised in waste management, mobility and lighting. \n• Coinciding with the celebration of the Smart City World Expo, it is the first time that a close look has been taken of the economic activity generated by Catalonia’s smart city sector, which demonstrates the importance of this sector within the Catalan business environment. \nBarcelona, November 15, 2016.- The Catalan Government presented this Tuesday a study giving for the first time an in-depth look at the economic activity generated by smart cities in Catalonia. The main conclusions of the report elaborated by Catalonia Trade & Investment – the public agency for business competitiveness – are that in Catalonia there are 270 companies in the sector, they give employment to 116,163 people, and, out of all their turnover, 6,969 million euros corresponds to their smart city activity. This figure represents 3% of the Catalan GDP, proof of how important this sector is for Catalonia’s business environment. \nThe report establishes that these companies are mainly specialised in waste management, mobility and lighting. It also specifies that the sector is largely made up of small and medium sized companies (82% of the companies are SMEs) and that is extremely internationalised: 51% of the Catalan smart city companies export and 17% have branch offices abroad. The companies with greater international presence are those producing equipment and products, those working in big data services and those manufacturing IoT elements. \nWhen explaining the motives behind the development of business activity in this sector in Catalonia, the report signals the existence of clusters, technological centres and universities that have specialised in this field in recent years. It also points out that in Catalonia there are 64 municipalities with over 20,000 inhabitants, creating a testing ground for the new technologies developed by sector companies, not to mention the public administration’s commitment in this area and finally the celebration of the Smart City Expo World Congress, the world’s most important event in this field. \nThe report also detects major international opportunities based on the nature of the Catalan business base specialized in this sector. It identifies that the Catalan companies have unique qualities to boost their presence in major developed European cities, in Latin America, the Gulf States, many regions in the USA and in major cities of the world’s emerging economies.

      "text": "New 5G Survey: 82% See IoT as Major Driver of 5G\n86% of respondents predict 2020 or earlier 5G rollout; IoT seen as top use case, highest-impact technology for vast majority of respondents\nCompany Release - 10/24/2016 8:30 AM ET\nWILMINGTON, Del., Oct. 24, 2016 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The results of a new survey predict that 5G will hit the market earlier than long expected and highlight the central role that the Internet of Things plays in driving the development of the fifth generation mobile network. The survey of 830 industry professionals revealed that an astounding 82% of respondents identified either consumer or enterprise/industrial IoT as the primary use cases for 5G, and 86% of respondents expect the initial rollout of 5G by or before 2020. Surprisingly, download speed was considered to be among the least important radio characteristics of 5G, with only 12% of respondents deeming it most significant.\nThe survey report was split into three categories: attitudes towards 5G, expected B2B and B2C services, and challenges around the network and radio requirements of 5G. The common thread among all three categories is that the main driver of 5G is to build a framework for the IoT. The survey was conducted by Telecoms.com Intelligence, the industry analysis arm of Telecoms.com, and co-sponsored by InterDigital (NASDAQ:IDCC) and Mitel.\n“Increasingly, IoT and 5G are becoming inextricably linked as concepts, largely due to the due to the plethora of identifiable IoT use-cases that will require 5G’s coverage and ability to manage an exponential increase in connected devices,” said Robert DiFazio, Vice President, InterDigital Labs – Future Wireless, InterDigital. “That being said, it will be interesting to see whether unexpected and high-value use cases will emerge to drive 5G, the way video-enabled social networking and the sharing economy did for LTE.”\nOther key findings of the report included:\n61% of the surveyed industry professionals predicted that IoT connectivity is the aspect of 5G that will have the biggest impact on operator service revenues. 67% also predicted IoT connectivity would have the biggest impact on society.\nSpectrum availability is the biggest challenge facing radio access for 5G networks, according to more than a third of respondents.\n68% of the responding Telecoms.com audience favor a gradual implementation of 5G that integrates LTE opposed to a “big bang” switchover.\nMassive IoT services will be the greatest beneficiary of network slicing. 63% of the industry professionals see the ability to scale bandwidth, latency and traffic prioritization for machine-based communications and data as delivering the greatest benefit.\nInterDigital develops wireless technologies for mobile devices, networks, and services. It is a key contributor to global wireless standards, designing and developing a wide range of innovations that are used in digital cellular and wireless products and networks, including IoT, 2G, 3G, 4G and IEEE 802-related products and networks.\nThe full survey report, titled ‘Road to 5G Outlook 2016,’ is available as a free download here.",

By the end of 2017, the company expects to have rolled out 20 commercial NB-IoT networks around the globe.\n“Besides technological innovation and product development, Huawei will proactively and relentlessly promote construction of the NB-IoT ecosystem and boost incubation of NB-IoT applications for a prosperous future for the NB-IoT industry,” said Zhu.",
